{"pageContent": "Purpose: Although it is the most powerful predictor of early prostate cancer treatment-related complications and quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes, most studies do not stratify results by baseline function. Further, reporting functional outcomes as averaged numerical results may obscure informatively disparate courses. Using levels of treatment-related dysfunction, we address these problems and present the final QOL outcomes of our prospective cohort study of patients with early prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "[FOCAL TREATMENT OF PROSTATE CANCER - LEADING AND FUTURE TECHNIQUES, OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34482675/"}}
