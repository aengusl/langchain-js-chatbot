{"pageContent": "Background: High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) allows noninvasive heating of deep-seated tissues. Guidance under magnetic resonance imaging (MR-HIFU) offers spatial targeting based on anatomical MR images as well as MR-based near-real-time temperature maps. Temperature feedback allows delivery of a well-defined thermal dose enabling new applications such as the ablation of malignant tissue.", "metaData": {"source": "Emerging Technologies and Techniques in Radiation Therapy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27986210/"}}
