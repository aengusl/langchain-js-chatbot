{"pageContent": "Background: Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is highly upregulated in human prostate carcinomas. Inhibition of FASN could arrest cell cycle and trigger apoptosis rapidly, implying the reliance of cancer cell survival on FASN. However, little is known about the effect of C75, a FASN inhibitor, and siFASN (that is, small interfering RNA targeted at FASN) on prostate cancer in living subjects.", "metaData": {"source": "Health-related quality of life in patients with advanced prostate cancer: a multinational perspective\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7613531/"}}
