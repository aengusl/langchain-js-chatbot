{"pageContent": "Background: In men with prostate cancer, pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) velocity (PSAV) has been demonstrated as a predictor of biochemical and survival outcomes in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP). The utility of pretreatment PSAV in predicting outcomes after radiotherapy (RT), with or without androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), is less certain. This study was undertaken to determine whether pretreatment PSAV is associated with biochemical disease-free survival, patterns of recurrence, and survival outcomes in men treated with radiation therapy and ADT.", "metaData": {"source": "Recent results of management of palpable clinically localized prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8319164/"}}
