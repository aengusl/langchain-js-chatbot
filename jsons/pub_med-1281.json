{"pageContent": "Erectile function has been shown to decline as a function of increasing peripheral blood inflammatory markers, namely the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). We evaluated if the association between NLR and erectile dysfunction (ED) applies to patients with localised prostate cancer. We included 1,282 patients who underwent brachytherapy. ED was classified before treatment according to the Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event Scale version 3.0. ED was defined as the need for the use of oral pharmacologic or mechanical assistance to have satisfactory sexual function. We found that patients with ED were older (p < .001), more likely to have hypertension (p = .002), statin use (p = .002), diabetes (p < .001) or an IPSS \u2265 8 (p < .001). On univariable logistic regression analysis, an NLR of \u22653 was statistically significantly associated with ED (OR 1.32, p = .029). But on multivariable analysis, the association between elevated NLR and ED was not statistically significant (p = .17). Significant were age (OR 1.12, p < .001), IPSS \u2265 8 (OR 1.50, p = .008), the presence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes (OR 2.27, p < .001), and prostate volume (OR 0.99, p = .041). The NLR does appear to be a surrogate marker of chronic inflammation that causes baseline ED in patients with localised prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Quality of life in prostate cancer patients\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8977989/"}}
