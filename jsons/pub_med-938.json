{"pageContent": "In a questionnaire study, men with prostate cancer (n = 155) or benign prostatic hyperplasia (n = 131) identified more sexual problems than did men from the general population (n = 129). Sexual dysfunction was acknowledged regarding sexual pleasure and attraction, erectile function and sexual satisfaction and sexual performance. Lowered rates of sexual desire, pleasure and attraction were found when comparing their situation in recollection of pre-treatment situation to the current situation. Lower intercourse frequency and sexual satisfaction were also found. Medication, masturbation and artificial aids to achieve erection were not used as substitutes for shortcomings of erectile function either by men with prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia nor by their partners. There seemed to be a lack of information about the illness and treatment consequences for sexual life, including what physical dysfunction to expect after surgery and also what possible help to expect to compensate for the shortcomings.", "metaData": {"source": "Interventions for sexual dysfunction following treatments for cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17943864/"}}
