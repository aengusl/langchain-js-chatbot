{"pageContent": "Financial toxicity is a broad term to describe the economic consequences and subjective burden resulting from a cancer diagnosis and treatment. As financial toxicity is associated with poor disease outcomes, recognition of this problem and calls for strategies to identify and support those most at risk are increasing. Men with localized prostate cancer face treatment choices including active surveillance, prostatectomy or radiotherapy. The fact that potential patient out-of-pocket costs might influence decision making has rarely been acknowledged and, overall, the risk of financial toxicity for men with localized prostate cancer remains poorly studied. This shortfall requires a work-up in the context of prostate cancer and a multidimensional framework for considering a patient's risk of financial toxicity. The major elements of this framework are direct and indirect costs, patient-specific values, expectations of possible financial burdens, and individual economic circumstances. Current data indicate that total cost patterns probably differ by treatment modality: surgery might have an increased short-term effect, whereas radiotherapy might have an increased long-term risk of financial toxicity. Specific thresholds of patient income levels or out-of-pocket costs that predict risk of financial toxicity are difficult to identify. Compared with other malignancies, prostate cancer might have a lower overall risk of financial toxicity, but persistent post-treatment urinary, bowel or sexual adverse effects are likely to increase this risk.", "metaData": {"source": "Feasibility study of a randomised controlled trial to compare (deferred) androgen deprivation therapy and cryotherapy in men with localised radiation-recurrent prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24946001/"}}
