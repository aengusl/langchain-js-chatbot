{"pageContent": "Tissue microarray (TMA) technology is a method for high-throughput analysis of tissue biomarkers, commonly used in translational cancer research. TMAs allow performing a variety of in situ applications on hundreds of tissue samples simultaneously using the same protocols as for conventional slides. Thereby, precious material from patient samples remains largely preserved while costs in resources and time in laboratory processing decrease. Therefore, a TMA is a powerful tool to identify and study biomarkers that may have a potential diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive value. Depending on the research question, there are different types of TMAs, such as progression TMA, outcome TMA, and tumor heterogeneity TMA. Since the first introduction of the TMA method almost 20 years ago, most laboratories used manual tissue arrayers for manufacturing. Nowadays, automatic or semiautomatic devices are commercially available, which largely facilitates the technical construction. However, preparatory work remains the most time-consuming part in preparing TMAs. This chapter focuses on issues involved in design and construction of prostate cancer TMAs.", "metaData": {"source": "Editorial comment to comparison of mortality outcomes after radical prostatectomy versus radiotherapy in patients with localized prostate cancer: a population-based analysis\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22640746/"}}
