{"pageContent": "What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Novel therapeutic methods have emerged in recent years as 'focal' treatment alternatives in which cancer foci can be eradicated and greatly reducing the associated side-effects of radical treatment. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) seems to result in a well fitted technology, which has proven short- to medium-term cancer control, with a low rate of complications comparable with those of established therapies. This is an up-to-date review of the available literature on HIFU as a definitive treatment of prostate cancer. It describes the technique in a comprehensive approach in terms of technical features, procedure, indications, and gives an overview of its historical background; finally, we present the future applications of HIFU and its development trend.", "metaData": {"source": "High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for definitive treatment of prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22672199/"}}
