{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men and the second leading cause of cancer-related death. For patients who develop metastatic disease, tissue-based and circulating-tumor-based molecular and genomic biomarkers have emerged as a means of improving outcomes through the application of precision medicine. However, the benefit is limited to a minority of patients. An additional approach to further characterize the biology of advanced prostate cancer is through the use of phenotypic precision medicine, or the identification and targeting of phenotypic features of an individual patient's cancer. In this review article, we will discuss the background, potential clinical benefits, and limitations of genomic and phenotypic precision medicine in prostate cancer. We will also highlight how the emergence of image-based phenotypic medicine may lead to greater characterization of advanced prostate cancer disease burden and more individualized treatment approaches in patients.", "metaData": {"source": "Anxiety and distress during active surveillance for early prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19637245/"}}
