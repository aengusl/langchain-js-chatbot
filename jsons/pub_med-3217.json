{"pageContent": "The outcome of patients selecting observation of clinical stage T1c prostate cancer is unknown. A total of 101 men with clinical stage T1c prostate cancer were evaluated, counseled, and monitored in a standard fashion. Altogether, 27 men who elected observation were older and had greater co-morbidity but similar tumor characteristics as compared with 74 men who elected radical prostatectomy. In all, 9 men demonstrated clinical or biochemical evidence of progression after a mean follow-up of 23 months; 4 men who underwent radical prostatectomy had specimen-confined disease and undetectable post-operative levels of PSA. Observation appears to be a viable option for some men with clinical stage T1c prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Race as an independent predictor of outcome after treatment for localized prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10492191/"}}
