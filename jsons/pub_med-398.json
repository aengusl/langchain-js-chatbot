{"pageContent": "Performance of 16 (16 g) (n=103) and 18 gauge (18 g) (n=101) biopsy needles in transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided 10-core prostate biopsies were compared in terms of cancer detection and pre-defined specimen quality criteria in this prospective randomized study. Cancer detection rates of the two groups were similar, although the mean core volume of 16 g needles was almost twice that of 18 g needles. On the other hand, using 16 g needles significantly improved specimen quality by acquiring less empty cores, small cores and fragmented cores. There were no significant differences among the complication rates and VAS pain scores of the two groups. Sixteen gauge needles can safely be used in TRUS-guided prostate biopsies, as they improve specimen quality without increasing morbidity and patient discomfort.", "metaData": {"source": "MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound: current status of an emerging technology\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23474917/"}}
