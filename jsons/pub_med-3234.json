{"pageContent": "The stage migration for newly diagnosed prostate cancer, improvements in prostate imaging, and devices capable of inducing subtotal prostate ablation have allowed for the formal study and evaluation of focal therapy for low-risk prostate cancer. Significant limitations remain: 1) the need for more accurate pre-treatment determination of cancer location, extent, and size, 2) determining appropriate methods of post-treatment surveillance and definitions of clinical progression, 3) the uncertainty whether repeat treatment, by focal or whole-gland therapy, is effective and safe. Clinical trials are ongoing to provide data on the feasibility and reliability of these new therapies, the capability of eradicating cancers, rates of secondary treatment, and impact on urinary and sexual function.", "metaData": {"source": "External beam radiation treatment for prostate cancer: still the gold standard\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1533146/"}}
