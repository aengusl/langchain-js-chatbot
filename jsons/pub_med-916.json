{"pageContent": "Purpose: Cancer of the prostate (CAP) is one of the most common malignancies affecting North American men with about 215,000 new cases and 35,800 CAP related deaths annually. The most prevalent intervention for localized CAP is radical prostatectomy (RP) with 10-year survival rates approaching 90%. Studies of men in post-RP recovery indicate that 44% to 75% experience sexual dysfunction and more than 60% experience distress in reaction to sexual dysfunction problems. These findings are increasingly significant as prostate specific antigen testing continues to increase CAP detection rates, resulting in more and younger post-RP patients confronting sexual dysfunction.", "metaData": {"source": "Sexual rehabilitation and cancer survivorship: a state of art review of current literature and management strategies in male sexual dysfunction among prostate cancer survivors\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23387915/"}}
