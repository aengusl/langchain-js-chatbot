{"pageContent": "Introduction: The management of Prostate cancer (PC), since PSA testing has been introduced in the clinical practice, has been significantly spoiled by a \"leading-time bias\" effect. As a consequence, this has brought to a dramatic diagnosis anticipation at the 4th-5th decade of life in sexually active and otherwise asymptomatic men. Standard options as radical prostatectomy or EBRT are hampered by a significant negative impact on patient's QoL. More recently several alternative minimally-invasive ablative treatment modalities have been proposed with promising results. Among these, TR-HIFU (Trans-Rectal High Intensity Focused Ultrasound) is playing a growing role in the treatment of localized low-intermediate risk PC, although long-term oncologic outcome are still awaited. In order to achieve an optimal result, a specific TR-HIFU's requirement is given by an unchanging target throughout the whole procedure. Therefore, the ideal anaesthesia should be either minimally-invasive and allow to get a motionless target up to 3-4 hours. A retrospective evaluation of efficacy and safety of a spinal anaesthesia in this patient's setting was done.", "metaData": {"source": "Editorial comment\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23639943/"}}
