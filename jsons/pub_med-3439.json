{"pageContent": "Introduction: Wnt signaling is important for normal development, cell proliferation, and cell differentiation. However, aberrations in the pathway can lead to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Recent genome-wide studies have demonstrated the frequent occurrence of Wnt pathway alterations in prostate cancer. Although alterations in the canonical Wnt pathway in prostate cancer may have an impact on prognosis, recent studies suggest that the noncanonical Wnt pathway also plays an important role in disease progression and treatment resistance.Areas covered: We review the literature with regard to the potential prognostic significance of noncanonical Wnt signaling in prostate cancer. After a brief overview of the canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways, we discuss the preclinical and clinical evidence for activation of Wnt signaling in prostate cancer. We focus on clinical evidence for noncanonical Wnt pathway components to serve as potential prognostic biomarkers.Expert opinion: Although many therapeutic options are available for men with prostate cancer, there remains an unmet need for prognostic and predictive biomarkers to precisely guide clinical management. Early evidence suggests that components of the noncanonical Wnt pathway may serve as prognostic biomarkers. However, prospective validation studies are necessary before these biomarkers can be routinely applied in the clinic.", "metaData": {"source": "Editorial comment.
