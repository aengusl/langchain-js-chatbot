{"pageContent": "In this study we report late bladder, gastrointestinal and sexual dysfunctions in 23 patients following radical radiotherapy (66Gy-70Gy/33-35fx, 5 fx/week) for prostate cancer. We interviewed the subjects by telephone and compared the results with those of 45 healthy population controls. In general, the patients' bladder function was well preserved. However, compared with the population controls, significantly more patients reported dysuria and hematuria. Twenty-six percent of the patients reported moderate distress from the gastrointestinal tract. Fecal urgency, incontinence and the use of sanitary pads, as well as diarrhoea, and blood and mucous were significantly more common among the patients. Thirty-nine percent of the patients reported moderate or worse distress upon sexual activity, and significantly more patients suffered from erectile impotence.", "metaData": {"source": "Sexual function reported by Japanese and American men\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18001788/"}}
