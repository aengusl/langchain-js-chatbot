{"pageContent": "Purpose: A single nucleotide polymorphism, rs10486567, in JAZF1 has consistently been associated with increased risk of prostate cancer. The physical interaction of zinc finger proteins, such as JAZF1, with heavy metals may play a role in carcinogenesis. This study assessed potential gene-environment statistical interactions (G\u00d7E) between rs10486567 and heavy metals in prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Risk perception, screening practice and interest in genetic testing among unaffected men in families with hereditary prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10741283/"}}
