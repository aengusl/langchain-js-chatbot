{"pageContent": "Poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) are enzymes that catalyze ADP-ribosylation and play critical roles in normal and disease settings. The PARP family member, PARP7, is a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase that has been suggested to play a tumor suppressive role in breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer. Here, we have investigated how androgen signaling regulates PARP7 homeostasis in prostate cancer cells, where PARP7 is a direct target gene of AR. We found that the PARP7 protein is extremely short-lived, with a half-life of 4.5 min. We show that in addition to its transcriptional regulation by AR, PARP7 is subject to androgen-dependent post-transcriptional regulation that increases its half-life to 25.6 min. This contrasts with PARP1, PARP2, PARP9, and PARP14, which do not display rapid turnover and are not regulated by androgen signaling. Androgen- and AR-dependent stabilization of PARP7 leads to accumulation in the nucleus, which we suggest is a major site of action. Mutations in the catalytic domain, the Cys3His1 zinc finger, and WWE (tryptophan-tryptophan-glutamate) domains in PARP7 each reduce the degradation rate of PARP7, suggesting the overall structure of the protein is tuned for its rapid turnover. Our finding that PARP7 is regulated by AR signaling both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally in prostate cancer cells suggests the dosage of PARP7 protein is subject to tight regulation.", "metaData": {"source": "From a woman's perspective: life as a partner of a prostate cancer survivor\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21429081/"}}
