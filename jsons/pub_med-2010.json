{"pageContent": "The disease trajectory of living with incurable cancer is characterized by increasing bodily deterioration and problems. In this paper, we have focused on the change in temporal awareness as manifested in the narrations of two men with hormone refractory prostate cancer and skeletal metastases as they approach death. The two men participated in in-depth research interviews during the last part of their lives, sharing a similar disease trajectory with increasing bodily change and decreasing physical function. Both died a lingering, cancer-related death. The first and last research interviews were analyzed using a discourse analytic method. Findings show that the temporal awareness in the interviews changes as the illness progresses and death approaches. In the last interviews, the present is flooded with bodily problems; the past and the future are hardly present except for the future beyond the men's own deaths. Pain, fatigue, nausea, and other symptoms figure largely in this change, and there is no time for much more than attending to bodily needs in a present that is dominated by problems. Here, the importance of alleviating bodily problems once again becomes paramount, and two questions are raised: Is the often reported withdrawal from life, when death is imminent, a physical necessity rather than a psychological one, and is it possible to free time from the time-consuming problems of the present by means of a more concentrated attempt to alleviate these problems?", "metaData": {"source": "[Mediterranean diet, micronutrients and prostate carcinoma: a rationale approach to primary prevention of prostate cancer]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14661397/"}}
