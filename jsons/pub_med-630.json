{"pageContent": "Background: The clinical value of heat-induced coagulation of prostatic tissue is evaluated as a minimally invasive treatment for patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and, more recently, localized prostate cancer (PC). To obtain a more detailed insight on the effect of heat on prostatic cells, heat shock protein (HSP) 27 expression of normal and malignant prostatic cells was studied.", "metaData": {"source": "Modelling prostate motion for data fusion during image-guided interventions\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21632296/"}}
