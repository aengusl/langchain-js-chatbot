{"pageContent": "Cancer cells encounter a hypoxic microenvironment during tumor growth and progression. In addition, androgen-deprivation therapy against prostate cancer can develop secondary to a hypoxic condition caused by drastic blood supply reduction because androgen drives angiogenic inducers including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inhibits angiogenesis inhibitor prostatic pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF). Extreme hypoxic conditions are not suitable for cancer survival, however, cancer cells soon adapt to a hypoxic environment and survive. We established a prostate cancer cell line cultured under chronic hypoxia and analyzed a castration-resistant phenotype. Here, the Vav3 was identified as a key oncogenic molecule associated with castration-resistance under chronic hypoxia. We analyzed the functions of Vav3 and Vav3-mediated signaling to establish a novel therapeutic target for castration-resistant prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer survivorship, deaths, and health care management\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33882148/"}}
