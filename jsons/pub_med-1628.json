{"pageContent": "Background: The age-adjusted rate of radical prostatectomy, the most common treatment of early (nonmetastatic) prostate cancer, increased almost sixfold between 1984 and 1990. This increase was due in part to reported improvements in postoperative sexual potency after the use of newly developed \"nerve-sparing\" procedures. However, published estimates from physicians of impotence following various types of radical prostatectomy may be low, since not all patients may report treatment-related complications accurately and completely to their doctors. In contrast, direct surveys of patients indicate much higher rates of postoperative sexual and urinary dysfunction. One problem with most physician and patient surveys is that they have been performed retrospectively, and pretreatment impotence and incontinence prevalent in older men cannot be assessed accurately in retrospective studies.", "metaData": {"source": "American Cancer Society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20200110/"}}
