{"pageContent": "As radical prostatectomy (RP) remains a commonly used procedure in the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer, we critically analyzed the evidence suggesting the role of pharmacological prophylaxis and treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) after surgery. Systematic literature review using Medline and Cancerlit from January 1997 to December 2006. Abstracts published in the journals European Urology, The Journal of Urology, The International Journal of Impotence Research and The Journal of Sexual Medicine as official proceedings of internationally known scientific Societies held in the same time period were also assessed. Patient selection and surgical technique (i.e., preservation of neurovascular bundles) are the major determinants of post-operative erectile function. Pharmacological treatment of post-operative ED, using either oral or local approaches, is effective and safe. Moreover, recent studies have shown that pharmacological prophylaxis early after RP can significantly improve the rate of erectile function recovery after surgery. Use of on-demand treatments for treatment of ED in patients subjected to RP has been shown to be highly effective, especially in case of properly selected young patients treated with a bilateral nerve-sparing approach by experienced surgeons. In this context, pharmacological prophylaxis may potentially have a significant expanding role in future strategies aimed at preserving post-operative erectile function.", "metaData": {"source": "The Natural History of Erectile Dysfunction After Prostatic Radiotherapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28859870/"}}
