{"pageContent": "Purpose: Current guidelines of the American Cancer Society and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend offering annual prostate cancer screening with prostate specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal examination (DRE) beginning at age 50 (age 45 in high risk men). There are limited data concerning outcomes if all men followed screening guidelines. We report early outcome data on men who entered a prostate cancer screening study, complied with the screening guidelines and were subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Quality of life following definitive therapy for localized prostate cancer: potential impact of multiple therapies\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12584476/"}}
