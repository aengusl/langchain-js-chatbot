{"pageContent": "The Kiel University technique of intensity modulated brachytherapy boost implantations complementary to external beam radiation used in the treatment of prostate cancer patients was improved by involving real-time three-dimensional transrectal ultrasound analysis of the prostate gland both before implantation and after the implantation but before capture of the transrectal ultrasound images for real-time dynamic treatment planning. Implantation technique, treatment planning procedure, and dose delivery are described as practiced at the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein Campus L\u00fcbeck, Germany.", "metaData": {"source": "Modeling prostate anatomy from multiple view TRUS images for image-guided HIFU therapy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17225800/"}}
