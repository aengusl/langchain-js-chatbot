In particular, we identified factors that may influence a comparison between prostate cancer patients and the general population, or confound the relationship when comparing subgroups of patients in nonrandomized studies.", "metaData": {"source": "A modified Delphi study to identify screening items to assess neglected sexual side-effects following prostate cancer treatment\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35277157/"}}
