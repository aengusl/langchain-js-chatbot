{"pageContent": "MRI guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) has shown to be effective therapeutic modality for non-invasive clinical interventions in ablating of uterine fibroids, in bone metastasis palliative treatments, and in breast, liver, and prostate cancer ablation. MRgFUS combines high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) with MRI images for treatment planning and real time thermometry monitoring, thus enabling non-invasive ablation of tumor tissue. Although in the literature there are several studies on the Ultrasound (US) effects on cell in culture, there is no systematic evidence of the biological effect of Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery (MRgFUS) treatment on osteosarcoma cells, especially in lower dose regions, where tissues receive sub-lethal acoustic power. The effect of MRgFUS treatment at different levels of acoustic intensity (15.5-49 W/cm2) was investigated on Mg-63 and Saos-2 cell lines to evaluate the impact of the dissipation of acoustic energy delivered outside the focal area, in terms of cell viability and osteogenic differentiation at 24 h, 7 days, and 14 days after treatment. Results suggested that the attenuation of FUS acoustic intensities from the focal area (higher intensities) to the \"far field\" (lower intensities) zones might determine different osteosarcoma cell responses, which range from decrease of cell proliferation rates (from 49 W/cm2 to 38.9 W/cm2) to the selection of a subpopulation of heterogeneous and immature living cells (from 31.1 W/cm2 to 15.5 W/cm2), which can clearly preserve bone tumor cells.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer arising in ectopic prostatic tissue within the left seminal vesicle: a rare case diagnosed with multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound fusion biopsy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26905875/"}}
