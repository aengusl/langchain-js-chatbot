{"pageContent": "High-risk prostate cancer poses a significant challenge to the treating physician and much debate exists regarding the ideal treatment approach. The purpose of this article is to enable physicians to identify patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer and evaluate whether monotherapy is sufficient for these patients. We review the current data on use of surgery, radiation therapy and hormonal therapy independently and in combination. We also discuss emerging therapeutics for high-risk disease including neoadjuvant chemotherapy and protocols under current and future investigation.", "metaData": {"source": "[Results of adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy in patients with locally-advanced prostate cancer]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19947382/"}}
