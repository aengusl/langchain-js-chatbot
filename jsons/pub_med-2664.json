{"pageContent": "The treatment landscape for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) has rapidly evolved over the past 5 years. Although androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is still the backbone of treatment, the addition of docetaxel or abiraterone acetate has improved outcomes for patients with mCSPC and become standard of care. With multiple treatment options available for patients with mCSPC, treatment selection to optimize patient outcomes has become increasingly difficult. Here, we review the clinical trials involving ADT plus docetaxel or abiraterone and provide clinicians with guidelines for treatment. Although surgery and/or radiation are standard of care for localized, intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer, these treatments are not routinely used as part of initial treatment plans for patients with de novo mCSPC. Recent clinical data are challenging that dogma, and we review the literature on the addition of surgery and radiation to systemic therapy for mCSPC. Finally, the standard of care for oligometastatic prostate cancer (a subset of mCSPC with limited metastases) has not been established compared with that for some other cancers. We discuss the recent studies on metastasis-directed therapy for treatment of oligometastatic prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Changes in functional status associated with radiation for prostate cancer in older veterans\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33388282/"}}
