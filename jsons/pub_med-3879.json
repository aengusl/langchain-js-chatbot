{"pageContent": "Recent decades have seen dramatic changes in the management of prostate cancer based on novel research findings. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening has been introduced, and then recently modified to include new strategies and biomarkers. Management of advanced disease has been transformed by the rapid introduction of new agents. We have moved from a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach in prostate cancer management to multidisciplinary strategies tailored to the individual patient and his specific cancer.
