{"pageContent": "Transrectal ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of the prostate is a widely accepted technique to obtain prostatic tissue for histological examination. Severe complications are rarely seen. We report a case of symphysitis causing hospitalization and severe pain and discomfort of the patient. Possible etiologic factors are traumatic osseous lesions and transport of rectal bacteria to the periosseous region. Especially in small prostates, care should be taken to avoid this condition. Prolonged perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis is mandatory.", "metaData": {"source": "Supporting prostate cancer focal therapy: a multidisciplinary International Consensus of Experts (\"ICE\")\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24597940/"}}
