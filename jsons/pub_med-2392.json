{"pageContent": "Purpose of review: Androgen deprivation therapy is a cornerstone in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and has extended the lives of countless patients. Unfortunately, many of these patients eventually succumb to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The efficacy of abiraterone acetate (AA, Zytiga) and enzalutamide (Enza, Xtandi) in the mCRPC setting prove that these tumors remain androgen-driven. We review recent studies that have shown that intratumoral androgen biosynthesis plays a significant role in the ever-evolving mCRPC tumor and we discuss the therapeutic implications of these findings.", "metaData": {"source": "Assessment of quality of life after radical radiotherapy for prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8944512/"}}
