{"pageContent": "Importance: Recently, genetic polymorphism in HSD3B1 encoding 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 has been shown to be associated with oncological outcome when treated with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer. Upfront abiraterone combined with ADT has proved survival benefit. However, its effect on oncological outcome among different ethnicities and in abiraterone treatment remain unclear.", "metaData": {"source": "Long-term outcomes of 60 Gy conventional radiotherapy combined with androgen deprivation for localized or locally advanced prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16275680/"}}
