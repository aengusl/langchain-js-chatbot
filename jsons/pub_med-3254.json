{"pageContent": "The role of salvage cryoablation of the prostate for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer that have failed radiotherapy to the prostate is reviewed with reference to alternatives including salvage radical prostatectomy and brachytherapy. The diagnosis and work-up of local recurrence/persistence of cancer in the prostate are reviewed and the patient selection criteria for salvage cryoablation is discussed. Technical aspects of the cryoablation procedure along with the outcome in terms of cancer control and treatment-related complications are detailed. The five-year biochemical disease-free rate is approximately 40%. The complication rate is acceptable. Salvage cryoablation definitely has a role in the management of localized prostate cancer treatment failure following radiotherapy, especially in older patients and those with some comorbidities.", "metaData": {"source": "Radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy for early prostate cancer.
