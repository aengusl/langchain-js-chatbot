{"pageContent": "This article reviews the most current methods and technological aspects of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), which is termed histotripsy. The rationale for focal therapy for prostate carcinoma rather than prostatectomy, which is being used extensively throughout Europe and Asia, is presented, and an argument for why HIFU is the modality of choice for primary therapy and recurrent disease is offered. The article presents a review of the technical advances including higher ultrasound beam energy than current thermal HIFU which allows for more accurate tissue targeting, less collateral tissue damage, and faster treatment times. Finally, the article presents a discussion about the advantage of ultrasound guidance for histotripsy in preference to magnetic resonance imaging guidance primarily based on cost, ease of application, and portability.", "metaData": {"source": "Salvage radical prostatectomy following primary high intensity focused ultrasound for treatment of prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21239003/"}}
