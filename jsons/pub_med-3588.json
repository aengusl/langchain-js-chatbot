{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer treatments often affect quality of life and problems may present at any point during treatment. Measuring and identifying issues of quality of life (QoL) may create an opportunity for the patient to discuss problems and induce information transfer from health professional to patient and vice versa. Many practitioners already assess QoL in patients with prostate cancer because treatment for the disease can have a dramatic impact on lifestyle. QoL may facilitate a more holistic approach to patient care. Using a QoL assessment tool may promote and enhance the current service provision and aid identification of bothersome side-effects, for example loss of libido, gynaecomastia (i.e. abnormal over-development of the breasts in a man), and hot flushes. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate scale (FACT-P) (Cella et al, 1993) is a prostate-specific QoL assessment tool, which can be self-administered and takes little time to complete. This may be a useful tool in the ongoing management of patients with advanced prostate cancer. With the emphasis on quality of service for cancer patients (Department of Health (DH), 2000; DH, 2007a; National Health Service Improvement, 2009), it is paramount that health professionals continually examine practice and the quality of the service delivered. Addressing QoL issues for the patient with cancer should be a priority. This article will outline the significant side-effects that a patient with advanced prostate cancer may sustain and attempts to indicate how QoL assessment tools may contribute to care management and delivery.", "metaData": {"source": "Do increased 5-year survival rates in prostate cancer indicate better outcomes?\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11042744/"}}
