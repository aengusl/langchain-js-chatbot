They can also be caused by an infection, another health problem such as diabetes, or some medicines.\nYour lifestyle can also affect the way you urinate \u2013 for example, drinking a lot will make you urinate more often, while alcohol, caffeine, artificial sweeteners and fizzy drinks can make some urinary problems worse.\nChanges to look out for include:\nLess common symptoms include:\nA small number of men get blood in their urine or semen*, or problems getting or keeping an erection.

You should empty it completely every time you urinate and you shouldn't leak urine.\nMost people can sleep for six to eight hours without having to urinate more than once. This will be affected by how recently you had a drink and how much you drank before going to sleep. As you get older, you will probably need to urinate more often. You may wake up to urinate once in the early morning \u2013 this is common in older men.\nIf you notice any of the changes we\u2019ve talked about here or you\u2019re worried about your risk of prostate cancer, visit your GP.\nYou can also call our Specialist Nurses, in confidence, on 0800 074 8383.
