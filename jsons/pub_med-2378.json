{"pageContent": "A 72-year-old man came to our clinic as a candidate of the donor of renal transplantation for his 44-year-old daughter. However, his serum PSA was found elevated, and he was diagnosed with stage C prostate cancer. He received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy and subsequent IMRT as a definitive curative therapy. Since his PSA remained at a very low level after IMRT for three years, we performed systematic 16-site prostate biopsy, which revealed no viable prostate cancer cells. His renal function seemed to be normal and no functional difference was noted between the two kidneys. Then, his left kidney was harvested by hand-assisted retroperitoneal laparoscopic approach, and transplanted to his daughter successfully. The suitability of a donor with two potential problems-advanced age and a history of prostatic cancer-was discussed, together with a review of the literature.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate Cancer Screening and Incidence among Aging Persons Living with HIV\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34555924/"}}
