{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most prevalent cancer with a high mortality rate. The early and accurate detection of PCa can significantly reduce mortality and saves lives. Hence, the nanomaterials based electrochemical nano-biosensors for PCa biomarkers will be the excellent alternative for diagnosis, detection and management of disease condition. In this review, we present a concise summary of the latest attainment and advancement in the use of nanoparticles for the diagnosis of PCa biomarkers. This review highlighted the importance of applying specific biomarkers along with nanomaterials like gold, magnetic, carbon nanotubes, and many other materials for developing electrochemical nanobiosensors in PCa detection. In addition to a summary on PCa detection, we further ensure future perspectives in PCa biomarkers detection, sensitivity, simplicity, rapidity, accuracy, cost-effectiveness and succeeding optimizations of novel technologies for more feasibility. Finally, closing remarks and an outlook conclude the review.", "metaData": {"source": "Spirituality and life-threatening illness: a phenomenologic study\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12861320/"}}
