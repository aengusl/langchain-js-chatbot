{"pageContent": "While focal therapy (FT) is increasingly endorsed for treating localized prostate cancer in the appropriately selected patient, management of recurrences following FT is not well-established in the literature. This case series describes three patients who received high-intensity focal ultrasound (HIFU) for primary treatment followed by focal laser interstitial thermal therapy (FLTT) for salvage therapy treated in the context of an ongoing clinical trial. Evaluation of these reported patients demonstrates that FLTT is feasible in the salvage setting with promising short-term oncologic outcomes and with the potential to preserve functional outcomes. Repeat focal therapy for previous failures is feasible however, it requires sophisticated imaging modalities for the accurate identification of recurrence and treatment of the tumor.", "metaData": {"source": "Step-by-Step: Fusion-guided prostate biopsy in the diagnosis and surveillance of prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31268636/"}}
