{"pageContent": "Objective: There is a growing debate about the important determinants of sexual satisfaction in men. Some authors argue that men's sexual satisfaction correlates with physical functioning variables such as erection quality and ejaculatory time. Other authors have suggested that the limited literature indicates that men's sexual satisfaction is related to psychosocial variables such as relationship satisfaction, depression, or anxiety. This study is the first to our knowledge to explore this question in men with prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Magnetic resonance image guided transurethral ultrasound prostate ablation: a preclinical safety and feasibility study with 28-day followup\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25464003/"}}
