{"pageContent": "The role of local treatment in oligometastatic prostate cancer remains contentious. Treatment of the prostate in metastatic disease may confer benefit, but prospective data are lacking. With improvements in treatments, aggressive strategies directed at metastases have increasingly become of clinical interest. Current evidence suggests good local control can be achieved; however, further data are required to determine overall cancer outcomes. This article evaluates the evidence available and consider whether local treatment of oligometastatic disease is a feasible, safe, and a positive strategy in this disease cohort. Cure should not be expected, although prolonged disease and treatment-free survival may be observed.", "metaData": {"source": "Polymorphisms inside microRNAs and microRNA target sites predict clinical outcomes in prostate cancer patients receiving androgen-deprivation therapy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21149617/"}}
