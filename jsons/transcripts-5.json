{"pageContent": " foreign thank you very much for uh allowing me to speak uh it's uh always an honor to do this and help out it's so I'm pretty passionate about so we're going to talk now about function uh stress and comments and more so I've no disclosures for this meeting there's no industry funding uh for this particular meeting so uh I'm a urologist in Orlando Florida I'm like many other urologists that did a residency uh in general urology then did a two-year fellowship and reconstructive Urology and joined a\n group here in Orlando with uh 2000 have been in the same group since that time I did a lot of work in regular general urology did a lot of prostate cancer surgery uh we were one of the first papers on focal therapy for cryotherapy uh we did kidney transplants during all that I did Urologic reconstruction uh and uh over the years became chairman of the department in our hospital system here uh near and dear to my heart has always been prostate cancer and I uh ran the American Cancer side prostate cancer support group from 2000 until American\n Cancer Society discounted that a few years ago uh you know currently I do mainly reconstructive Urology again that's what my fellowship was in and uh and now probably 80 to 90 of all of my work is reconstructive biologists and a lot of that is taken care of uh men who have gone through some of the side effects to prostate cancer as well some other things uh we're considered a center of excellence uh here in Florida uh these are the things that we treat but we're going to focus really on the things that\n are related to prostate cancer uh today I'm going to cover things on erectile dysfunction just general population information we've talked about those uh things that are specific to prostate cancer patients and some of the restorative therapies we'll talk about Peyronie's disease and you know what's this about penile length loss we'll talk about stress and comets and uh and foreplay and kindness and climate bacterial education on some of the new things that are out there so let's talk about erectile dysfunction\n so it's the inability that you achieve and maintain an erection to complete intercourse it's estimated that up to 30 million men in the United States suffer from erectile dysfunction prior to Viagra coming out only about 10 to 20 percent of the men saw treatment uh and now that's uh very different and uh much easier to talk about so what is interaction so on the screen there on your left hand side as a you know softer flaccid penis which is not filled with blood at all so it's uh it the penis involves three chambers the\n two top ones there are what are the main erectile bodies and the bottom the Corpus spongiosum uh really holds the urethra in the center but that also fills the blood with an erection and that's connected to the head of the penis when an erection occurs which you can see on the slide here is that blood will flow in through the artery so the arteries are right here the cavernosal arteries and the dorsal arteries of the penis and they fill those chambers and that's really the penis is really a big blood vessel and so when the smooth\n muscle relaxes blood flows in and then what you'll notice is these little veins the blue uh the blue vessels on the images there when the erectile bodies fill you'll have compression of those veins so blood goes in no blood comes out that's how you generate a pressure and you get an erection and so these are the veins when we talk about being a sleep they don't close and blood leaks out you don't get an erection so that's the anatomy of what we're talking about when you look at uh\n at what is an erection so interesting study Massachusetts male aging study looked at men a lot of different uh conditions but one they looked at was erectile dysfunction was surprising to me when I turned 40 to know that 40 percent of 40 year olds have erectile dysfunction and whatever decade of life you're in is about the instance of erectile dysfunction so it seems to be a normal consequence of Aging it's not to say that everybody gets erectile dysfunction but is much more common than we think and this is\n just men who have not had prostate cancer it's just all men coming in saying you know if you have erectile dysfunction we have some men are in their 20s that are wrecked out this function obviously that's much less percentile but again overall if you look at men in the 40 to 70 age group uh about 50 of all those men have erectile dysfunction so it's very common out there so what are the cause of erectile dysfunction really the four major risk factors smoking diabetes hypertension and elevated cholesterol those domain\n risk factors for coronary artery disease so anything that is good for your heart is probably good for your penis and your erections so if you can control your smoking and obviously eliminate that uh uh control diabetes control hypertension your cholesterol those are going to be very helpful helping your erectile function going forward we look at pelvic surgery and in our you know group we're talking here you know radical prostatec we would count you know that's a very common cause of erectile dysfunction\n which we'll talk over a lot of other things hormone abnormalities other types of conditions can also affect erections and create issues one of the very interesting things about erectile dysfunctioning it's a warning signs for coronary artery disease so the way this slide reads if you look at the arteries in the middle of the screen there you'll see that the penile arteries on our far left and it's really smaller re about one to two millimeters in size and then there's the coronary artery that goes to\n the heart carotid artery the femoral artery and what you see is they all have a big Lumen there so blood can flow through easily the very bottom of the slide there you see what happens when you uh occlude the Lumen by a certain percentage and what you'll see is that the penile arteries become the narrowest most quickly because they're the smallest artery so when you have narrowed arteries and penis you'll have less blood floated penis you'll have more likely to have erectile dysfunction so what we find is that men who are\n young 40s 50s and have erectile dysfunction that may be a warning sign that you know what your coronary arteries are probably also narrowed and with a little more narrowing you may get things that would lead to heart attacks and strokes so here's what corner arteries look like you see are these are critical lesions uh you know this lad there that's the Widowmaker you know that gets narrow then sometimes that supplies most of the heart but these are just showing how those arteries can narrow over time and you may not know\n that's happening in erectile dysfunctioning view warning sign so this is an interesting study showing uh from the prostate cancer prevention trial study they took men who they followed over time had questionnaires validate questionnaires and as they started these men do not have erectile dysfunction and as they went through the study they then developed erectile dysfunction then they follow them over time and what they found is that over five to seven year period these men once they had erectile dysfunction they found that in a\n five-year period eleven percent of those men one in ten are going to have a coronary event or a stroke and so it just tells us that if you develop erectile dysfunction you have about a 10 instance of having a cardiac or a cardiovascular event in the next five years so again if you have erectile dysfunction uh it's worthwhile being evaluated for coronary heart disease and vascular disease overall all right let's get back to erectile dysfunction so what do we have for Ed these are all the different treatment\n options so it's not all about just pills or surgery but we have a lot of different options and so we want to go through these so you know what's out there again talking about non-farmal pharmacological options again things you can do for your General Health are going to help your your erectile function as well as your Journal health so again no smoking reduce fat and cholesterol in your diet limit alcohol consumption regular exercise and weight loss are all very helpful speaking specifically to weight loss very interesting study done\n uh early 2000s placebo-controlled trial looking at men that were overweight and one group uh end up getting counseling and educating how to lose weight the other group did not they follow them over time what they found is that those men who lost 20 percent of their other BMI their body Ms index had a statistical Improvement in their erectile spores in their inflammatory markers and those endothelial cell function markers that uh that they were able to track showing that if you can lose weight and improve your you know\n your overall health you'll have Improvement of your erections as well so obviously diet can also help so anything you can do to improve your diet is helpful better than go getting a bag of chips you know snack on fruits uh you know nuts and berries uh and these are all just some listed here to tell you what are some of the good foods that we use and recommend and so in our practice we have a sheet that we give to patients so you know they want to make some dietary changes we tell them like these are the healthy snacks to do and that\n little bit of Education go a long way all right let's get to uh what are the specific treatments we have so we all know about the standard uh pills that are out there you know Viagra Levitra Cialis Jackson and Stendra are the current pills we have available in the United States uh they work by improving blood flow to the penis they do it really throughout the body but be focused and receptors are more concentrated in the genital area and they don't replace anything they just make your processes work better so they\n uh and I will show you how that works so uh in Florida here we have a lot of Engineers at the Space Coast and they like to know how do things work so this is how it happens so when you look here on the upper part of the slide here it says endothelial cells and neurons those are the nerves so when you talk about your your prostate cancer surgery this is what they are sparing when they do that surgery so when you get those nerves get stimulated by whatever is it excites you it goes down the nitric oxide pathway it goes down here and what\n you'll get is you'll get more of this green box here to cyclic GMP what that does it changes the calcium concentration with smooth muscle cells and decreases that so that they relax and they open up so blood can flow into the penis so more of this cyclic GMP means you have more of an erection so that's the normal this is having an erection the way we don't walk around the erection all day long is this little purple circle here pde5 is an enzyme that breaks down cyclic GMP into a non-cyclic form and what that then does\n that makes the erection go away so how do our medicines work Viagra see Alice and the like they block that enzyme so when that enzyme is blocked that cyclic GMP can accumulate in a higher amount for a longer period of time so it's a better erection that lasts longer and that's how the bills work they don't replace anything they just stop the breakdown of your normal your normal signals that generate an erection there's another kind of pathway just to show it and so uh if you can see my arrow we're really looking at this very\n bottom left-hand side of the screen you know that's that and that purple there's that cyclic GMP that's you know that's the way that that works to create the erection all right let's talk about the net uh the pills just in general so this is a a Farmall connected curve showing you how it works sometimes this helps make it more understandable but at time zero on X here is when you take the medicine and then this is on the y-axis is the concentration in your blood and what you'll see is that in about one hour you\n get a peak level so that's when you're going to get your best response with Viagra in another time it goes down and you know by out here six to eight hours it's almost out of your system altogether but that's the drug absorption curve for Viagra or sildenafil here it is for Levitra about the same Peak at one hour and then Cialis is different so Cialis when you take that pill at Time Zero it takes you almost three to four hours to get to a peak level so we find a lot of men who come in trying Seattle say that that\n stuff doesn't work well if you take and try 15 20 minutes later way down here you're at the bottom of the drug absorption curve and you're not going to get the same response you will as if you try it three to four hours so uh and then in terms of elimination takes longer to uh to have that eliminated by the body and what you'll see is still in your system you're about 16 to 24 hours later you've still got significant levels uh that's why they call it the weekend pill in Europe because this lasts for a long time\n okay so this is a a chart part of a handout that we have in our office we've got a handout that we use for erectile dysfunction and again this is to help men understand how to how to make the medicines work best for them so um you know got the name of the drug in the far left the doses are there you put in bold the maximum dose you know you're making sure you're taking the highest dose possible and then time to Peak so when do you get your best response so again helps them to know when they should expect to have their best\n response duration is there like how long is your system then food interaction good to know that Viagra Levitra if you have heavy fatty food or alcohol will decrease the absorption so you don't get as good a response and then listed are the side effects there those are mainly side effects of dilated blood vessels that's what a headache is so some men will get a headache some people will get stuff you know some people get facial congestion uh those are all the things that we'll notice with these medications\n and they it's really a class effect the way I built this chart was in the very top is when you take it on demand like tonight's tonight so who's taking that day the very bottom there is to Dallas filler Cialis which is a daily dosing of this and you see five milligrams the maximum dose you take that and then in three to five days you'll have a steady state level where you'll get a response we oftentimes use that for Rehab because it may be helpful to have that in your system all of the time and sometimes use boost where you\n take an additional dose when necessary but just to give you an idea how those work I think it's helpful especially here in Florida grapefruit juice helps to increase the bioavailability of all these drugs what they do is uh the grapefruit will juice will bind to and inhibit the protein that breaks down the drugs you'll get a higher level just have to be careful you're taking cholesterol medicines in life because they may have a similar effect so who cannot take these medicines it's those who have coronary artery disease if you\n carry nitrogly turn or you use any Nitric nitrate containing blood pressure medicines you know those really are the big no-nos and the reason for that is that Viagra is initially developed for coronary artery disease to help dilate blood vessels they found it didn't work very well at the heart worked better somewhere else but it still has an effect there somewhat and when you take Viagra and you have a cardiac event say you take it you have the ability to have relations and you have a stress test that you fail and you get chest pain and\n then you take nitroglycerin you now have two medicines you've taken They Don't Really act additively they actually are by multiplying effect into this dramatic drop in blood pressure and people have had Strokes uh heart attack dysrhythmias from that and that's with that depth so cannot use those together if you do take these medicines and you have any chest pain we recommend an aspirin obviously call 9-1-1 and the ER can use different medicines to help you control your chest pain okay so here are that is one of my\n favorite signs so we had a lot of men in my practice a lot of my thesis are sent from urologists uh saying look this stuff didn't work go see Brady he'll you know do surgery on you um we take a step back and say let's make sure you're using everything the right way so this is to make sure you're using all the pills the right way so number one stimulation is important we still have men who come in they take a say a Viagra and then they're looking down saying okay maybe I'll have an\n erection and uh that doesn't work you need to be stimulated you need those nerves to be stimulated to help the whole pathway start so uh gotta figure out what gets you excited uh you know have these medicines work best timing of uh taking the medication again knowing that you need to take the medicine whether it's Viagra about an hour ahead of time see how Cialis say two to three four hours ahead of time you will get a better response if you do it at the right time uh dietary concerns again if you're\n going out and be romantic it's your anniversary and you're going to have a wine and a heavy fatty food uh you know a nice meal you know your Viagra may not work as well and Cialis may be a better option but know that those can those medicines can affect how your your medicines work number four is it requires multiple trials the first few times you try the medicine you know most men they they used to get a sample they go home they take a pill and they you know they've got their wife or their girlfriend or partner saying okay let's\n go you know now they got pressure for the see how it's going to work uh they may be where are they going to go blind are they going to have some horrible reaction so all that stress uh works against having erection so what we find is if you take medicines multiple times uh you'll tend to do better you kind of compare over six to eight Trials of the medicine first three or four times you don't have as good a response to do with those last say four to five times and there you get tend to get a better\n response so try it more than once one time would not mean that you're it's a failure number five is maximize dosing again you want to make sure that you're at the highest dose possible that's safe for you there are some off-label uses at higher doses than our FDA approved more common outside the United States where we're not as a protogenous but you can consider those as options as well number six again grapefruit touch base on that maybe improve your uh you know how the medicines work and then you may want to\n have your testosterone checked if it's not working well testosterone replacement can help if your levels are low so what a good thing to check if that's you're not getting good response okay so let's shift ears that's that's how the medicines work let's we're here to talk now about prostate cancer um you know these are the treatment options for prostate cancer starting up there with active surveillance and then you have surgical or uh radical prostatectomy of radiation therapy crowd\n therapy and haifu so we'll kind of go through a little bit of this so just to give you anatomically how we do things again hopefully you can see my arrow here but uh this surrounding shows the bladder here uh you know up above which is the prostate here sitting at the base of the bladder and then here's the urethra that goes out to the penis and again what we have here is the nerve the neurovascular bundle so when you have you know your nerve spare that's what the your urologist uh you know is trying\n to do to keep that taxi that function but when we do a radical prostatectomy whether it's open whether it's a robot pyreneali however it's done you are removing the prostate here which is again at the base of the bladder we remove the seminal vesicles and over here on the right side of the slide we do is that gap which is what a prostate used to sit you then Stitch that together so we bring the bladder down to the urethra and Sutra it and that's the anastomosis or the connection we put a catheter in there to allow that to heal\n but that's structurally how we do that show you some of the other treatments for uh for prostate cancer this is brachytherapy which is where you put little seeds or pellets into the prostate and on the right side here is uh sort of the old-fashioned externally in radiation therapy that's how it used to be done you lay it on a table in a uh radiation game from above and went back you know through your body and just hit kind of in one plane and that's the old-fashioned uh external beam radiation therapy just a picture of how we do the\n seeds this almost looks like uh if you remember the battleship is you got a little grid you're putting the needles in there they'll deposit these little pellets and those pellets stay in the prostate they're there for the rest of your life the deal emit radiation over the course of the next few months so you don't have to go into the office the radiation oncologist's office every day and if you had an x-ray this is what it would look like so you see those pellets in the drawing and the left and then you\n can see the outline of the prostate you'll see the center they try to spare the urethra so you don't have as much of a radiation effect there that's brachytherapy if you haven't seen this is imrt so um what you'll see which is different relative to the old external irradiation there is you you'll see you have different planes of that radiation therapy will come to hit the prostate so that will eliminate or minimize that I should say the scatter through around the prostate if you just came from the\n front to the back the rectum sits behind the prostate and that would get a lot of dose of radiation we have a lot of side effects of that this kind of distributes that scatter effect through a broader range of tissue to hopefully limit toxicity that you know that may occur with with intensely modulated radiation but this is uh this is how we used to do it I used to do it again people are asleep in the operating we put little Pros that go into the prostate those little ice balls at the end of the probes and uh that would then ablate or\n destroy the tissue uh very effective again is a very technique driven and high food somewhat similarly it's a probe goes in uh to the rectum in that sends a signal to the prostate to destroy the cells that are there hopefully treating obviously the cancer cells so that's high so that's kind of a just a walk down what are the different treatments for those who are looking uh for uh prostate cancer management so um the great thing about our treatments is all of them work very well and so it's trying to figure out what's the\n best for you so with a highlighted cure you use side effects uh as a guide to say you know what are things that you would be most comfortable using um and I would say the side effects are obviously more common with surgery surgical interventions that's an immediate effect that we see so survivorship now is about improving your quality of life and you know how do we do that and it's one we want you to be cancer-free we want you to be potent that means to have still have erections and we want you to be\n caught we don't want you to be leaking urine and so that's the trifecta when you look at what are the good outcomes for prostate cancer management and then again we don't have post-op complications or and once you have negative surgery margins when you're taking out the prostate and that's sort of the pen to factor those five things you're looking for when you're having prostate surgery so we look at those as you're kind of your guide those are the top five things you're trying to get when you have your\n your your treatment these are some of the other things you ought to consider and these are things we are learning as urologists we go forward following patients and you telling us what are the problems that you have so we're going to talk about Peyronie's disease the length of the penis and some things that uh related to leaking urine at times when we're being sexually active so let's touch on erectile dysfunction first so what I he did here is I put surgery on one side radiation therapy and the other\n way to talk about each of these side effects because surgery and radiation therapy the most common treatments we have so whether with surgical whether it's robotic or open when you remove the prostate the erectile dysfunction is an immediate effect like you'll know that right after the surgery has happened it is very much age dependent it will be dependent often what's your erectile function prior to having your surgery like if you have great erections before it you have a better chance of having\n reasonable erections later your erections are very poor before surgery surgery is not going to help it's just going to make it worse and you will have a harder time getting back likely to your Baseline the surgeon's ability also will have an effect on your outcome if you receive any additional radiation therapy later on and then if you uh work with a rehab program all those things can help you know give you have a better chance to have an erectile function down the road radiation therapy again delayed\n effect does not happen right away happens to be with surgery kind of a drop off right away radiation therapy do well for a while that they you start to have issues with erectile function later and then those curves kind of cross where usually about three to five years later the erectile function is about the same for both both categories but again surgery will have something that's more dramatic so looking at ejaculation so radical prostatement prostate is what makes the fluid it nourishes the sperm when you have your prostate removed you\n will not have fluid come out afterwards you may have a small amount of uh of uh pre-ejector fluid is usually from urethral glands but you won't have the same amount of fluid that came out before orgasms should still happen you should still feel that and it is separate from uh from erections you can have an orgasm or a sensation of ejaculation and be completely flaccid or soft uh most time they do occur together but they do not have to uh interestingly uh ten percent of men say that ejaculation is more pleasurable after the prostate surgery\n I'm not sure why that is uh now looking at radiation therapy prostate is still present so you like will still have some seminal fluid come out but as the radiation has affected usually it's a you have the dose and then over time the radiation will start to destroy cells you'll have less viable cells that are in the prostate making that and usually within three to five years many men do not produce humans so that Siemens that that may decrease over time fertility issues radiation therapy you have to be\n careful if you have radiation therapy child bearing age you can have radiation effects some sperms we recommend not getting pregnant for a year and there's a little data per se specifically on an orgasm as it relates to ejaculation so let's talk about prostate cancer and Peyronie's disease so uh when you look at men who have had uh radical prostatectomy they have a higher instance of erroneous disease than the general population so if you've had your prostate removed 15.9 percent of men in one study had\n Peyronie's disease versus up to nine percent in general population the average amount of degree of curvature was 31 degrees so you know that straight line 30 degrees with the uh that's whichever direction that is radiation therapy you don't have any data on Peyronie's disease radiation therapy so I've not seen that so yeah this is a a photograph of a dorsal payronis disease or an upward curvature or something right lateral curvature left lateral can be downward we call that ventral and then some has some just narrowing we\n call it hourglass deformity where again you give a band of scar tissue and what happens with this is if you look here there's a cross-section of the penis and you're kind of looking on end and what you'll see as you develop a plaque it's a bad term it has nothing to do with plaque in the arteries uh the heart or plaque on your teeth right that's the name that people have used it's really fibrosis and that's probably a better name what fibrosis does it creates a tethering effect and the way we describe\n Peyronie's disease if you can imagine a cylindrical balloon uh and then you put a piece of scotch table on the length of the balloon and then blue the balloon up where that tape is is that same fibrosis and that tape won't allow the balloon to expand the other side has no restrictions you have a functional longer side and shorter sides of the balloon will curve on the side with the tape same thing happens with with our erections with Peyronie's disease uh and that's really what we see with peer\n running seats so again out of uh Morristown Kettering John Mulhall did a study looking at uh you know a group of patients and again they had a about a 16 incidence of of Peyronie's disease versus uh we see a general population nine percent and interestingly erectile dysfunction or function did not really play a role so uh just having a cathe or just an uh uh procedures done to put you at risk for payrolli's disease do have some treatments for that uh xiaoflex is the only FDA treat treatment option for\n that it's a collagenous enzyme that breaks down that scar tissue uh and it's FDA approved for those who have 30 degrees of curvature stable disease and a palpable plaque uh and again you know I'm in the sexual medicine side and there's there are those throughout the country who treat this and I think those are the best people that probably uh at least talk to you have this as an issue um and again we do this and usually we'll give you a block to note up the area and just showing it's an injection\n right into that scar you should try to break down the the fibrosis and uh and rarely do we do surgery specifically for Peyronie's disease we usually treated with with medicines but some you know we still do surgeries on a fair number of that all right so let's go then to penile length now what's the story on that so what we have found is that 70 of men will complain and say that they have lost a penile length after their prostate surgery as urologists we used to say that you know that that's not\n accurate that can happen take out the prostate put everything back together and the length should be the same what we've noticed is that you do have loss of length over time that's now been shown do not see that radiation therapy we think it's related to loss of of erections and so uh first study that I saw looking at this is 1993 uh you looked at 100 men after radical prostatec and this is before the robot it was the open prostatech I mean what they found is that men had a reduction in penile length of nine percent and the\n overall reduction in penile volume 22 percent and then looking at this is a prospective randomized study by one of my old mentors at University of Miami Mark salloway and looked and saw that in in almost all parameters men the penis was smaller and overall what it found is that you likely have atrophy of the penile tissue as you're not having erections and so um so and again they found that sparing of the nerves did not seem to be protective of that so it is likely a bigger process and again likely not having blood filling the penis\n stretching it out keeping that tissue healthy is likely what's happening there so so how can we prevent that so it is really uh being engaged in a rehab program or a pre-app program or doing something to get those erections erections are good for erections so as you lose your reactions after um say prostate surgery or any time you lose your erections you will likely have some loss of your function as time goes on so men will have erections to be younger you have erections uh five to six maybe eight times a night you have\n erections easily when you're 18 years old even when you don't want them to happen and that's probably something that helps keep that tissue healthy as you have oxygenated blood that goes into the space fills the space up uh and uh and and keeps that endothelium and that lining of the erectile bodies healthy so we don't completely understand what's happening but it is that highly oxygenated blood and stretching probably helps keep everything uh functioning optimally and that's we want\n to replicate in any kind of post-surgery rehab program so um so again overall again P length loss Peyronie's disease uh we do see it in prostate cancer good news is that if you do do rehab and you're able to do uh be uh follow that over time we find that men do get their penile length back if you don't do anything you tend to lose that oftentimes you now length it's lost so we want to do that fairly early uh last is foreplay incontinence and plan bacteria and it says we've not seen that radiation therapy described uh in uh\n with radical processing we have seen again foreplay incontinence is the loss of urine with just simple arousal with your partner climacteria's loss of urine with climax when you uh when you actually have that orgasmic sensation so um so let's go to some other things so these are just other concerns that again in our handouts that we give patients these are things we talked about so just talking about recurrence so if you have uh prostatectomy and then you have recurrence you can then do additional radiation therapy I would say as a\n reconstructive Urology who takes care of people uh patients down the line those patients are less problematic for me May managing them for things like incontinence and Ed and the like because they still do well um you take men who have had radiation first and then they have recurrence of their prostate cancer and then you add what we call a salvage radical prospecting or both of prostate afterwards or cryotherapy or high food those patients have much more in the way of severe complications they tend to have be harder for us to treat and we\n actually do our surgeries to help with incontinence we have a special pathway for them because we know that they have a higher complication rate so we treat them differently and really it's just that for some men they're going to get both therapies if you've got really say more aggressive disease and you have a high chance of having both um and I I'm sort of I don't push people one way or the other I'm I'm a surgeon I used to do a lot of prostatectomies you know and I tell patients now look they\n both have pretty equal outcomes you have to figure out what makes the most most sense for you for those who have high risk disease and have a chance to have I mean both therapies my my recommendation would be to consider this surgery first and then add a radiation therapies you need afterwards that people tend to heal better in that sort of sequence rather than radiation first then surgery and that is really the only that I really sort of tend to push people towards surgery because again I don't want to\n have people have problems down the road so now looking at other issues we see down the road uh in in recovery so radiation therapy tends to have uh more so in the past but still has increased risk of secondary cancers so the bladder has a exposure to radiation therapy as does the rectum and so you know there are some studies to show uh higher percentage of those and follow-up as you go down the road we do see dystrophic calcifications not infrequently amount of head radiation therapy we almost never see them in surgery and that's\n where the prostate becomes calcified and sometimes it creates obstruction or blockage and and that's something we have to deal with later we do see occasionally bleeding or hemorrhagic cystitis and unfortunately that happens sometimes 3 5 10 15 years after they've had radiation therapy uh and again iot as urologist we see that very uncommon with surgery but more common with radiation therapy and then fistulas very rarely that with with surgery more common with radiation or combination of surgery and radiation but\n again fortunately they're rare we do see anastomonic strictures of bladder neck contractures or vascular National contraction that's where the prostate in the bladder uh I'm sorry how to put back together you will occasionally see uh strictures there less common Now with uh how um surgeries are being done you can see it also with radiation therapy they tend to be in the ball bar urethra members erythrop uh but again uh fairly similar there I would say with radical prosthetic and you see more lymphaseals\n which is uh they remove the lymph nodes and Palace and those lymphocyles can grow rarely do they have to have anything to be done but if you do have symptoms they can be drained we do not see lymphaseals with that radiation therapy but again these are these are good lists just to say okay talk with your urologist or radiation of collagen say tell me what about your experience of these and what they have so two words again or few words just on radiation therapy again you know radiation therapy side effects are\n delayed you know you don't see them until uh down the road and it's usually years um you know and I think radiation uh oncologists are great uh and uh and they offer great service but I will tell you that it's really the urologists who are dealing with these problems down the road so you know radiation oncologists you know probably medical oncologists sometimes don't even know that these these things happen but because they're not managing it's us who are kind of treating these problems down the roads\n they do see they do happen I'd also say that radiation uh disasters are the worst disasters so if somebody has a problem with radiation therapy um you know it's a lifelong problem and uh rarely do I tell people that have a diversion but I I stole two in the last two weeks and their radiation therapy complication issues from you know years past but uh but again I think most of the time this is not a problem uh surgery radiation very often go very very well foreign on prostate cancer what you should be\n thinking about as you're making your decisions now let's talk about what are we going to do to help our erections get better after treatment so if you've chosen to have a radical prostatectomy um can you do any therapy beforehand so what we recommend is to get a vacuum reaction device before you have your surgery try to do some stretching beforehand without a band just get comfortable using the device and see how it works we oftentimes will encourage men to start with the phosphodasters Inhibitors like Viagra\n seals beforehand just again get used to the medicine as you've never taken it before and that's shown to be somewhat helpful there was an interesting animal study done looking at pelvic nerve Crush injuries where they uh they took sildenafil and they gave dosing along with a crush injury what they did is they gave it to three days prior to the injury an hour beforehand and three days later and what they found is that those that had the the dosing three days beforehand had the best response so they had a higher intercorporal pressures and\n the mean pressures and penis they were much better uh and and the uh and they had lower uh sort of uh apoptotic markers or cell death markers than the other group so again it is probably helpful to prime your erections prior to getting across the tech community and so we would recommend that and those who could take those medicines let's go through a little bit about how do we do surgery so this is a kind of a schematic or drawing the far right side is labeled the bladder you see the prostate in the middle purple and then the urethra is\n down uh to the left side and what you'll see in yellow those are the nerves and that's what control the erections so when you have your prostate surgery you can do different things and you know you can ask what does your urologist do to help protect the nerves and so they'll do things like a thermal nurse bearing which is they don't cauterize on the nerve some people do a special graph for the take breath from the back of the leg and they can put it there and then they'll also sometimes put a tissue that\n will help nerves to heal but the things will factor and to give you your best outcome for excellence or if you're a younger patient if you've got really good erections beforehand and then if your surgeon is experienced and uh and has a good track record those are probably the three best things to say that you're more likely to have a better outcome with your erections and so when you have your prostatectomy you see here the prostate is now removed you see the bladders there and the urethra's there and the nerves are now\n intact they've not been cut going out to the penis which is just beyond the urethra there and then when we we stitch that urethra and bladder back together we put a small cathe in there to drain the bladder again those nerves have to recover and what you'll see is you we have to dissect the nerves off of the prostate and so they'll have some effect from that so the nerves tend to go to sleep from the manipulations even if you spare them that kind of trimming the nerves and go onto the prostate and\n pushing the nerve away you'll have um you know you'll have kind of a neuropraxia where they will not function and work as well so um what should we do or when should we start working on our erections so this interesting study looking at uh how long after radical prostatectomy did we see venous leaks occur so if you check for venous leaks four months after your prostate surgery you've not done any rehab 100 percent of men have been asleep if you check that at eight months then 30 percent out of venous leak if you\n checked it a year and 50 out of leak and so what you're finding that as time goes you're having more and more venous leaking you're having progression in the damage to the penis that's occurring so earlier is better that's your window of opportunity if you want to have good erections that you should work on it right away um because again that's that's your time to prevent some of this damage that occurs from you stopping having erections and not having blood you know fill the penis on a routine basis\n so Ed programs are out there uh you know in the United States now some studies show that up to 80 85 percent of people are recommending uh programs uh routinely and so I think that's that's a good a good sign um and again so how do we have and looking at measurements of outcomes so if we take men this is mandated radical prostatectomy and then treat them with viac and this is studied in the early 2000s again this is not a robotic but a radical prostatectomy and man had actual interactions beforehand they had a very\n good experienced surgeons from the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio uh and and then they looked at if you gave men Viagra afterwards what was the outcome 80 had uh overall efficacy if you then looked at the nurse bearing status and so those nurses show you there's a right and there's a left and we can spare both and we sometimes decide ten years your pathology is very uh favorable you can spare both so you got bad cancer on one side you may go wide on that side and take the nerve and not spare it and despair one side so when they looked at\n their data if you spared both nerves you had an overall 71 uh response to Viagra if you spared one Nerf it was really 50 and then if you went widely and you took both nerves you'd say oh that probably won't work at all even still 15 percent of men had a response to viac so again if you've got good erections good surgeon and you use Viagra afterwards you have a good chance of having response and knowing you know when you've had your surgery ask your surgeon you know how the nurse parent go would\n you spare both for one or not and that will help you to predict you know is Viagra and that class of medicine is going to work that class of medicines requires the nurse to be there to be functional so it tells you about your function so yeah erectile preservation so intraoperatively your surgeon will do some things to improve your outcomes and then postoperatively what are things you can do uh to help again get your erectile function back so one is doing pharmacologic rehab which does the medicines uh doing vacuum reaction\n device and trying to work on the nerves to improve their uh their response so again what you're going to do is beforehand going to take the uh any of those Viagra Cialis combination uh consider starting to use vacuum device interoperatively your surgeons are going to do that for you and then post your up you're going to work on these uh these other options that are there and so what you want to do with your penile rehabilitations you're trying to decrease the ischemia or lack of oxygen in that tissue which then may lead to\n fibrosis and then fibrosis leads to the issues that you have so again the pd5 Inhibitors you're going to use those they require the nerves to be effective so early on viagara in Cialis may not be as responsive of now they're much more affordable now in the past I would tell people look if you can't afford it don't worry about it early on but now these medicines are much more affordable I would highly recommend being on them if it's safe for you to do that because I think it'll make a big difference the\n vacuum reaction device I think is helpful and we're going to talk about news as well so medicated urethral suppository they used to say that for maybe you'll see an erection but really it's it's medicated urethral suppository for erections it's a prostaglandin pill which is a compound that is a vasodilator you place that into the urethra it's usually refrigerated then melts it's then absorbed through your research go to the three erectile Chambers to promote blood flow so this is a little cartoon of how it's done and\n you see the applicator a little pellet about the size of a grain of rice and what that'll do is that that medicine's concentrated and that diffuses into the erectile bodies to give you your your response um just a word on that uh about say 10 15 percent of men will notice a significant burning with that medication so it's good to try that out see if that's an issue for you it's not I think it's a really great medicine to consider trying black interaction device for those who have not seen that before it's a it's an\n external cylinder that goes over the penis uh there's a battery and hand operated pumps the hand operator pumps you usually get higher pressure so I tend to recommend those but they both work well um to use it for erections you put a band on the base of the of the cylinder of the device you pump it up you get an erection then we should slip the band off of the cylinder and that'd be on the base of the penis and that's for using after you've had you know if you do have erectile dysfunction beforehand and for\n rehab I really recommend it more for just stretching I want blood to kind of come in and come out and so um so we have a protocol for that which uh you know we go through if you're in the office and you know here's just a picture is actually patient's having surgery brought in this devices so you're bringing let's see what you did and he what he did to prevent or get back some of the loss of length um you can we measure it we encourage them to do this so uh you'll see they're kind of the left side of the slide penis\n that's the opening the penis would go in there and that first marker is a little Sharpie marker where he marked where the penis was when he first started doing the vacuum then he did it routinely what he saw is he kept getting some some improved length over time and so some men will get sometimes an inch or two of length back that they didn't have so when we're doing a prosthesis I really believe that that is a better stretch we can maybe put in a bit longer of a device so we really encourage that for\n surgery but again good to help try to get some function of that so injection therapy intracavernosal injection or penile injection therapy is injecting your medicine directly into those erectile biotics so usually with these medicines if you want to have an erection you take the medicine from the refrigerator check it right into the side of the penis I have to do one injection the chambers are all connected and that will promote blood flow to the penis um you know it it's our best medicine for erections you say what if I want to\n get somebody erection how can I do it this is medicines most likely to do it obviously the delivery system is not ideal using a needle uh either the pns is uncomfortable I would say men describe this they do it they say it's like pulling the hair out of the back your hand that's what it would feel like so it's a little bit of a mild discomfort you hold pressure afterwards to minimize some bruising and then uh you know blood gets uh goes into the uh into the penis usually it happens in about five minutes\n um it's a like I said it's a pretty reliable treatment in fact our biggest risk is something called private which is an erection lasts too long after say three to four hours your body starts to use up all the oxygen in that blood and then it starts to hurt because you're now having ischemia at that point it's what we call a compartment syndrome and you have to decompress the system or you know you'll have long-term issues so to learn how to do this we usually have to come to the office we do a slow dose in\n the office sometimes we measure the blood flow with ultrasound I don't do it that often but but some urologists May and they're just checking to see how everything works but again you can then affect your dosing based on uh on that to get the best response possible goals to have erection for about an hour again this just shows you a cartoon how we do this so it's an injection on the side of the penis here and then that medicine uh you know the the connection between the two main erectile bodies there's a septum which is incomplete so\n blood flows in between both Chambers they you know they'll both expand so you don't have to check both sides the way you go back to this little uh you know pathway of getting erections so again in the bottom left is how do the pills work on the right hand side is how do these injections work and so they work by the it's phentolamine for pattern you know prostodyl they work through the cyclic ampute pathway again to create dilation so you have different Pathways to get a similar effect which has improved blood flow to the penis\n uh this is just an instance uh uh this is an advertisement from our local newspaper the patient brought in for me and said uh do you do this and we uh um just a word about uh about uh uh shot clinics and they're everywhere in the country it's a big uh it's a big business basically what they do is you'll come into the office and say do you all know why I don't have erections you say yes I want to know why they'll give you an injection they'll do an ultrasound they'll measure blood flow\n they'll tell you've got a Venus leak or arterial issues and hey this shop work do you want to buy it and um you know people say yeah I want to try this this is good I haven't had erection years so they'll say uh great and then they'll say well if you buy a six month it's going to cost this much and you get a discount if you do a year um I see people leave these clinics with a bill of sometimes two to four thousand dollars um they Mark these medicines up at a tremendous price uh they will uh they'll\n assume you're not going to shop around and see what's what else is out there um for your urologist we who treat this uh you know we we don't sell it we're not usually we're not compounding pharmacists but what we do is we give you a prescription we send you to a company pharmacists they'll send you the vial it's usually about 90 to 100 in that bio less you know three to four months and so um so know that your urologist does this if you see in the paper uh these companies usually don't have any your\n urologist doesn't have so uh you know again I would call your 24-hour hotline and see if you can uh you know connect with somebody there um all right so uh penile Rehabilitation so again the pills are very helpful uh this is what we recommend uh or sorry this is a kind of pause for a second I'll go back to the slide you can just fix this one but uh so uh this is a study uh by uh rayna's group looking at uh following post radical prostatec 19 availability debilitation again he took men in good erections they use the the pd5s\n afterwards like Viagra Cialis we started that right after the catheter was removed they did vacuum reaction device and they didn't use and they did a protocol what they found is that about 70 75 percent of men rather have intercourse at six months uh you know spontaneously without using all these medications so again good uh you know good evidence that this can help so this is sort of a version of our protocol which changes over time you know based on you know how things are for individuals but uh prior to surgery two\n weeks before and we really encouraged prehab and so again using things like Cialis uh five milligrams daily to promote blood flow and health to that tissue trying to convey the endothelium and highly oxygenated blood is helpful um vacuum reaction devices where you can do some stretching uh and um trying to help with a filling that space even if it's not oxygenated blood it's really about half of what we see with uh with a normal arterial erection there's probably some health to having that tissue stretched\n and then maybe try and use ahead of time you sometimes hard to get uh recently has been challenged we have some compounding pharmacies that can sell a gel compound which works similarly and again uh you can assess the CDA burning is it comfortable uh to at least so that now you're ready for when the time is right that you could do therapy so once you've had your surgery immediately afterwards uh you know I think it's a good time to start so you know if you're done well from surgery not having issues\n again what you consider still using the medications like Cialis once the catheter comes out look at using the vacuum ration device and use to see if we can get uh some response the vacuum device and really just have you stretching tissue out really not using the bands per se early on just yet filling that space with with uh with blood so down the road looking about a month or so after the surgery our goal ultimately is to get three to four erections every week um and the vacuum device doesn't really count we want you to have blood coming\n in from medicines uh or uh one of the different ways that we can uh stimulate a standard uh arterial erection so obviously you're going to check your blood work check your PSA over time testosterone may be helpful to do using the Cialis routinely using a vacuum device and then using the El prostitial and compound gel we'd like you to try to get those erections to potentially use them uh three months after surgery um is really a time when we really start to push and try to get a better response so if you're on your daily Cialis you\n know you talk with your urologist sometimes We'll add a boost dose which this additional dose at the right time um you know or changing different medicines using some Cialis and Viagra and see what kind of response you get uh again same with the vacuum device and the Muse and what we'll do is oftentimes we'll start to consider if people are not getting a response using the injection therapy to see if they get a response and then we continue to follow this over time so many times your urologist will do this uh you know if\n they're robotic surgeons and their goal is for them to have the best outcomes possible it's possible they'll be implementing these uh these programs with you or find a a urologist like in the sexual medicine Society who can help uh you know there's there's no those of us who want to help okay so if none of this works you've tried all the medicines and say you've waited you've gone through therapy you're now a year or two years out you still say you know I am not getting erections and I want to have\n erections we have this is an inflatable piano prosthesis the the three-piece prosthesis and so this is the surgical correction of erectile dysfunction and so uh the way this works you have a pump that goes in the scrotum is all done put down by a small incision but the pump is in the scrotum there's a reservoir which is behind the abdominal wall and then the uh the two cylinders in the penis they count as one so those are three three pieces and when you want ever actually you pump the pump which is in your scrotum a fluid get it's a normal\n saline goes through the pump goes into the cylinders so that you then have an erection like this you know the direction as long as you want uh you have an hour uh a day a week There's no problem with that when you're done you press the button it goes back the fluid goes transferred back into the reservoir and the penis goes back to being softer flaccided and so you know it would look uh like this and this is what it looks like when you you can't see anything that pump is completely invisible it's\n uh hidden under the throttle skin uh so here's somebody pumping up the erection and then when they're done you press it it goes back down so you're going to be flossing so again you know other looks of how things look so again that person there on the left keep your uh at the YMCA and have a shower you never know this person has a devices these are completely a visible uh nobody knows they're there so when you look and say where are these being placed so this is again a cross section of the penis you\n see our three erectile Chambers we're putting these these cylinders in this space right there two Corporal bodies they're not just sitting under the skin they're in a defined space in those erectile bodies and that's that's where we're gonna put them so the surgery takes anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes because it's done by a small incision for me I do the scrotum some do it above the penis uh but it's an outpatient procedure they tend to go home the same day um and uh once you heal up you'll have\n the ability to have an erection so there are pros and cons to everything so the the upside of a of a penile prosthesis it allows things to be spontaneous once you have a device in place and once you're able to uh you know learn how to use it you know you'll have an erection in 30 to 60 seconds so you don't have to wait and stay gosh my medicine I took it I got to wait three hours for it to work you know you can be spontaneous it's reliable it will work every time so it is not as though you say gosh I had some heavy fatty food\n that maybe this won't work you'll you'll know it's going to be able to work it it's natural then it goes up and it goes down you don't walk around like with it you know the old-fashioned malleable prosthesis that's always rigid you know this thing is soft and we describe you know against invisible nobody knows that it's there so it allows you to return to intimacy Medicare covers this like they do for all procedures the 80 they cover and most private insurance as well so again we we encourage men to\n pre-operatively use the vacuum device again to combat the loss of the piano atrophy loss of size that we see many men complain about because I would say that's one of the bigger complaints after penile prosthesis my penis is shorter than what it used to be so we try to use this to help with that again same thing you've seen before we try to stretch that tissue out so what are things to know about piano prosthesis so one outpatient procedure go through I do through a small incision with scrotum we dilate the erectile\n bodies to create the space to put those cylinders around like removing any tissue it's just a soft tissue we uh where we place this they come in multiple sizes not one size fits all they're small medium large extra large and super sized which we call the moyad and that is a uh they're not called that but uh he would I figured markerly um but they uh they um they do come in different size and we we size appropriately to the uh each person's size we place each component separately that's how we get all those things in\n there through one small incision we put one part at a time that we make connections uh we put a light pressure dressing and then usually we use this in about two months our success rates or satisfaction rates are 90 to 95 for both patients and partners so you know people who ultimately get to this really uh do like these uh these treatments uh so we're in an orthopedic hospital so here's our patient's next door to somebody who just had their uh their uh their leg surgery and um you know you can recover really well\n but post-operatively what we do is we have a pathway so much like your robotic surgeons who have a pathway for their surgery those of us who do a lot of this type of surgery we've got our Pathways and so we do specific things to try to make you as comfortable as possible afterwards and so we use things like Tylenol and neurontin and we have a special local anesthetic called xproel which lasts for for three days so most men wake up and they they don't even know they had surgery so again you want to work with people who have have these\n sort of plans for you afterwards to help your surgery uh work out well so what you expect out there of penile prosthesis I call the first couple weeks yeah I hate documentary once the local anesthetic Works off uh wears off you're going to sit there and go uh why did I do this and so uh so men are uncomfortable we put a penile prosthesis that usually uncomfortable and tip of the penis and then scrotum but that does get better with time um some people take a little more time but again usually most people are able\n to use the device in two months uh again penile shortening his biggest complaint so again using the backing device and some of the models of prosthesis and and some of our protocols help to minimize that shortening afterwards now what are the risks we've already talked about the upside so anytime you put any device or any kind of foreign body any body there's a risk of infection so our standard infection rates used to be about three percent now they're down about one to two percent uh that's\n because these devices are not coated with antibiotics to decrease the infection rates uh the devices do have a certain life span on average they last about nine to ten years uh 75 are still functioning at the 15-year Mark so they uh lasts better than most cars but uh but you know they may not last forever um and the way they would fail is if that they develop a leak in the system and you know sailing weeks out your body reabsorbs it you won't feel it but when you pump it up it won't pump anymore uh and uh and that would be uh the typical\n fare that we see erosions are fairly uncommon but used to be more common with a malleable advice really they kind of work through the tissue but uh not not common uh at this point and the other thing to know is that penile prosthesis is really not reversible so say you know I'm going to try a prosthesis you can't then say well wait a minute now I want to go back and try the shots or try something else because the uh these cylinders sit where the erectile tissue is so you know I like men who at least consider all the\n other options try all the other options and if they've done work this is a you know this really is a great option for those who are other things are not effective okay so a lot of times you know if you know prosthesis are good for life so if you compare implants to other medical devices such as like hip replacements knee replaces uh heart valves these tend to last longer than all these other medical devices that are implanted so okay these are just for some of our patients who um you know I've done these\n uh lectures for patients for years so we kind of compiled some of the frequently asked questions that men have you know how long do they last and again you know nine to ten years is a is a is the average of some last minute much longer when you look at Steve Wilson who's really The Godfather of prosthetic Urology did over 2000 implants you know so the five-year survival rate for for him his uh series is 95 and the 15-year rate average Step uh ranged up to 60 up to 87 so again these 10 intend to last a long time\n uh another question was can you or your partner feel a prosthesis during intercourse and know the difference um I'll say again your partner will not know that you have any plans in place uh they can't feel it they don't know the difference uh they may become suspicious after a few hours but uh for the most part your partners will not know you have advice uh what happens to break down or leaks again say you do have a leak in the system again you probably won't perceive anything your body reabsorbs that\n ceiling but the device will not work now if you want to have a working function device we can remove the device and place a new one so you know their procedure uh if you say like I really don't care I don't use this device anymore you leave in place there's nothing that says that has to be removed or that if that occurs it's not like a silicone breast implant where it's a problem this is something that really is not that big a deal if you have a leak again patients asked you have to remove\n anything I've had people think we're going to take out a testicle or take out part of the penis to do this we don't remove anything we use your natural spaces to play solid advice uh well this change the sensitivity of the penis so this little cross section so is the very top uh you know right up here if my arrow shows it and you can see that those are the nerves that give sensation to the penis so they're on the top side so I'm doing my surgery on the bottom side so again I've not had\n anybody say uh with standard straightforward prosthesis surgery that there's any change in sensation of the penis so you really don't expect that after this foreign will this be like my normal erections again I would say that the erections are not as long as they used to be so you don't tend to have as much elongation as you used to have and then the head of the penis the glance cap that doesn't fill uh like it did when you're young so these erections uh me try to get them uh as best as we can to the same size you\n were but again I would say it's usually like the best Direction you have just a centimeter or two shorter um questions about this affect your ability to ejaculate the answer is no these are two separate processes and uh very rarely are there any issues of ejaculation after a penile prosthesis maybe five percent uh we usually just have to teach you to do it the normal way because again ejaculation is a reflex so you have to just the fact you have an erection doesn't mean you have climax you've got to be roused\n stimulated to get down the pathway to F climax and that does insurance pay for the prosthesis again Medicare does many carriers do um the code for this is five four four zero five so if you you know call it back if your insurance card and say does my policy cover five four four zero five you don't have to tell them what it is to say that that's the number they can look it up and tell you if it's covered oftentimes related to prostate cancer it is covered um you just have to kind of ask for that uh and then will this be a problem for\n my wife or female Partners return to sexual activity again if you've not been sexually active for years you know you want to we want this to be a a healthy thing for both Partners so sometimes your wife's or Partners seeing uh uh their gynecologists sometimes doing things to improve the lubrication of the vagina Sometimes using lubricants can all be helpful and you can adjust how rigid you are but the goal is to make it be pleasurable for everybody so uh in conclusion for erectile dysfunction wide ranging options you\n have you know pills and injections and and whether it's an external pump or a penile prosthesis all these things are reasonable options surgery safe and it's really as minimally invasive uh we have high satisfaction rates for both patients and partners with low risk uh and that actually does cure the problem that you have so you're not really relying on anything else uh and that's the lecture there for erectile dysfunction uh Dr Moyet asked to go over some things about restorative therapies for erectiles functions so\n these are kind of the newer things that are out there so let's kind of review what's out there um so the low intensity shock wave therapy is uh stem cell therapy stromal vascular fraction and platelet-rich plasma so let's kind of go over these one at a time so Shockwave therapy so we use shock waves for treating kidney stones but what we found is that by using shock waves some studies show that you'll get new blood vessels that get generated when you create this sort of uh micro trauma and micro stress in the local\n environment and then you'll get some stem cells and growth factors that get released because of this micro trauma so so what Urology started doing is they started doing this Shockwave therapy to the penile tissue and what they saw is again you started getting neovascularity to hopefully get better erections there are different types of uh delivery units I would say at least in my review the radio wave therapies uh are different they don't have as much penetration and they don't have as much energy that gets\n delivered to the tissue so you have less of the effect that you want so tend not to be as uh as as responsive so you know anything that has it you know call it you know radio wave or something wave those are tend to be the radial release of this and you tend not to be as responsive and this is what it looks like so on the left side here is the focused way these that go through they penetrate the tissue to it up to 10 centimeters at a higher energy level whereas the radio waves are more diffuse and not as deep and not as much energy\n as released so you know those are the different um types of therapy that are given um they uh it's expensive it's not covered by insurance a lot of these private practices and Spas will will charge you 500 up to a thousand dollars a session I've you know the patients I sometimes see will say they spent five six thousand dollars to see if they're able to get a response and you know those who ultimately see me really don't tend to get a response so I may see a skewed version of that population but that's usually what we'll\n see so let's talk about uh platelet-rich plasma PRP so what happens to that is that blood is drawn out blood is drawn from you it's then centrifuge or spun down to get the blood to separate into the cells and and the the supernatants and what they do is they take the kind of sensor layer that has uh this platelet-rich uh uh layer and that's extracted and that's uh sort of a process with calcium and that's just injected and it can be ejected in different parts of the body it is a uh orthopedic surgeons really do a whole\n bunch of this will inject into almost joint or part of the body that hurts uh and can you somewhat responsive uh plastic surgeons are doing that this one we've found was called The Vampire Facelift where they had all these little micro injections throughout the you know throughout the the face to kind of rejuvenate the face and that's completely Rich plasmid so um idea there is rejecting that to create uh uh you know response uh and tissue recovery and done in the penis and uh and that's again being offered uh\n out there stem cell therapy same idea but like the idea of it sounds good on paper or you are taking stem cells injecting into the uh into this tissue as a building block to help replace diseased tissue um when you take these in aggregate you look at the aggregate you look at these type of therapies um you know there it you can have where people are going to offer this and you know some people will pay for it our sexual medicine society and the American neurologic Site put out kind of a position statement saying what we should\n be doing this we think that the therapies are really interesting and hopefully in the future would be uh something that can be offered we have to figure out how to do it how to make it work well make sure it's safe and so until these studies are done the restorative therapy should be reserved for clinical trials not offered in a routine practice so if you go to somebody's office and they say look we'll do this injection therapy for you or do the wave for you we're going to charge you a thousand dollars I probably\n wouldn't go for that but if you're in a center that says that's a studying these things say look you just enter into a study and we're going to track over time how you come that's really the thing where I think I would look at and be an engine being a patient there all right so that's really the you know that's the uh this lecture uh you know kind of focusing on erections and different things there so I was going to pause there and leave it open for any questions and uh then we can figure out\n where that traffic light is and what's wrong with it um you can kind of let us know what you find of that uh hey what's wrong with it and then B uh where is it what part of the country and I'll leave it at that all right so uh uh they've asked us also to talk about uh stress urine incontinence so let's talk a little bit about that um so again the disclosures no disclosures related to this talk uh again a lot of different things that we treat in our Clinic uh we're to focus on today really\n is uh is stressier and incontinence so again prostate cancer treatment a lot of times you'll be cured your side effects from all these treatments and we're going to try to uh improve your quality of life and our Focus uh here is going to be stress your incontinence uh for those this is a I have an expanded version of this talk if you use your phone I go on this QR Reader uh you you'll have a longer lecture uh if you want to get into more detail but we're going to give you an overview of that\n right here so lots of different types of urine incontinence this we're going to talk about is treating stress urinary incontinence or post-prostatectomy incontinence and this is after you've had surgery you know damaged and sphincture you'll have urinary leakage there's also urgents which is I got to go to the bathroom real quickly it comes out before I get there that's the most common type that's out there we also have overflow incontinence and uh mixed urinary incontinence but uh but we're\n going to talk about stress in your thoughts and this is a cartoon showing like what's what are the different types of incontinence what happens to those but again the stress and cons the far left if you have something that stresses of bladder you have increased pressure in the atom that creates a pressure pressure effect you know then urine is going to come out that's what we're looking to treat so how do we have normal continents and normal control so uh a stable bladder is one that holds a certain amount of a\n certain volume a certain amount of urine at a low pressure and that's called a stable bladder and then below the bladder is the urinary Center which is right here you can see on the diagram at the base where the prostate is and it's a complex it's made up of the bladder neck which is the intrinsic or involuntary sphincter and then it's the uh the voluntary or the extrinsic sphincter is really right here which if you can see it is uh that little uh layer below the prostate and that's what wraps around urethra and\n creates control and so those are what Keep Us control and when you have surgery at the intrinsic voluntary Sinker is oftentimes removed and you depend on that extrinsic voluntary structure and that's what we're looking at so and this shows you here where that arrow is that members urethra that's where the the muscular that that sphincter urethra muscle is what creates that control for us after you've had your prostate removed because again with radical prostatectomy they're going to come in and they're going to remove if\n you can't see the arrow here right here in the bladder neck this whole tissue here is removed and then they'll take this segment right here and they'll reconnect it to the urethra right there and this is the urethral length they talk about they say is your urethral length good the longer that urethral length is probably means you have a longer Sinker as well to give you a better chance of being ultimately dry that's kind of the anatomy we look at with urinary control so what can you do pre-operately to try to improve your\n outcomes with control and so on know your risk factors so if you are older so if I take group cement if I take a you know a group of you know 40 and 50 year olds and they have surgery by a surgeon and then you take another group say that are you know 70 and 80 year olds and they're operated by the same surgeon the younger guys can have better control of that question it's just their tissue tends to heal better and they have uh you know better long-term control body mass index those who are are not overweight if your surgeon has to work\n hard and if he struggles in the operating Journal so goal is if you can lose weight so some people if you're waiting to get to surgery you really thought yeah when I was doing prostate can't support I tell guys look your service two months out get an exercise program now you can lose 10 pounds 15 pounds if you go to that surgery healthier you have a better chance of having a better outcome across all parameters so I really encourage that um and now if you have any other urinary issues beforehand more likely to\n have those afterwards so again once you improve your diet increase exercise uh consider doing pelvic floor therapy learn what that is beforehand so you're ready to get on that right afterwards I think that's helpful and then pick your urologist YZ so again like I said if you um just like for me I do a lot of this type of surgery I don't do any robotic prostate surgery but I do a lot of this type you want to find somebody who's going to remove uh your prostate somebody who's done a lot of these\n um and you know there are different numbers of what makes them experienced you know some would say you know after they've done a 100 or 200 they're probably uh you know very good uh but yeah I think the more experience they have the better off you're going to have in terms of your your outcomes and you know what they're going to try to do is do everything anatomically and if they can spare the nerves they can spare the bladder neck and put everything back together in a topic that's ultimate you\n want likely get your best chance at having good recovery so again uh other thing you could look at as I mentioned about that membranous urethral length what they found is that if you have had an MRI and you have and they can evaluate look at how long is your urethra you'll find that if your urethra is longer than 12 millimeters or 1.\n 2 centimeters you tend to have a better control and I can say from what I did used to do prostatec means open I remember those patients where you could look down and you see and you saw they've got a nice long urethra off the end of the prostate it may the dissection for us easier uh and those patients you just come near there and do better and that still holds up today so intraoperatively so what can your surgeon do uh that can help make you have a better outcome afterwards so one uh nurse bearing so prospective study looking at uh uh you know nurse bearing\n status and what they found is that if you have both nurse bear uh you know we've talked about this before we can spare both nerves or just one nerve or no nerves if you have both nerves that go to the erectile bodies and they are spared men tend to have a better urinary control afterwards so if you're from a cancer standpoint you're gonna have bilateral I would go for that again if you can have a bladder next barrier approach where they really dissect out in atomically the bladder neck so it comes down to a nice funnel and then\n oftentimes they'll do they'll reconstruct the posterior part of the uh floor of the bladder to take tension off the anastomosis and they're different names for it some people call the Rocco Stitch but if you can if you ask your surgeon do you do a reconstruct a posterior reconstruction you know they looked at you and say they've never heard of that before uh you may want to at least ask questions of some other surgeons and blood loss blood loss is another predictor of outcome so if you have less\n intraoperative blood loss then um you know you have a better chance at having immediate continents uh you know if you have a lot of blood loss and you have leading as the case is done that just means you don't have good anatomic control you may but pressure is the anastomosis is there if there's bleeding uh in that space and they stretch out the anastomosis and create problems so when we look at those things as the nurse bearing status modern experience and the blood loss are important predictors of uh outcomes for having\n good urinary control afterwards um so again talking about uh surgery and radiation therapy in what order so again for those patients who have high risk disease that you may need to have surgery and radiation therapy you know what are we looking at um again those who had primary prostate surgery and then had radiation therapy added on afterwards usually there's limited effect on urine incontinence and there may be some benefits to saying when do you do that radiation therapy so say you've had your prostate surgery and\n there's a question about positive margins uh and and your urologist wants a radiation oncologist wants to do radiation therapy there likely is some benefit to waiting until you get the best control possible because say you're still leaking at the two to three month Mark if you can wait till you get control maybe at six months or a year and your PSA is still very low and then add radiation therapy at that point that may improve your your urinary control long term there may be an advanced that and then if we look at incontinence\n rates after surgery and then adjuvant radiation Theory that's where we add radiation therapy after the surgery we'll see the encounter rates are 15 to 20 percent the erectile dysfunction rates are really 70 75 to 80 so um still 20 of men are getting erections uh after that so there's some uh response there if you do it the reverse so say we take somebody who's got you know high-risk disease they have radiation therapy first and then they have recurrent cancer uh uh and they need to have their prostate removed or\n ablated much more challenging situation that surgery is much more difficult Those Who removed the prostate have a challenge uh when you heal we see you've got these calcifications that form at the bladder neck and anastomosis very often these men have recurrent urinary tract infections uh and these are the guys that are really tough for us to treat they'll oftentimes have bladder neck contractures strictures will sometimes see fistulas and when you compare the incontinence rate and the erectile dysfunction rate it's really a\n different world um so those had radiation first and then get a salvage prostatectomy the incontinence rates are 75 and sometimes higher in the erectile dysfunction rates 100 percent uh all these men have problems afterwards of these other issues but again sometimes this is the way that we need to you know try to cure the disease when we talk about how much or how does prostatectomy or post-prostatech and economics infects affect someone's life it is a significant impact on their life when you compare Pro incontinence after\n prostate surgery it is seven times more distressing than severe erectile dysfunction so you know uh patients of these uh interesting questionnaire they looked at how much would you be willing of your life survival to give up to get your control back for urine control uh you know these men I said almost two and a half years of their life they'd give up to be able to get their their incontinence managed better versus only four months that they give up for erectile function so so post processity incontinence is uh is really it's a\n devastating problem it's my favorite thing to treat because we really oftentimes can make life much much better for you if we uh um if we have a chance so let's look at the instance of uh of incontinence after robotic surgery uh looking at a high volume these are high volume centers uh in the late 2000s uh 2009 8 000 patients one year follow-up looking at stress incontinence uh notepads uh at one year 84 of patients I mean 16 were still incontinent at one year and then uh you know zero to one pad uh incontinence at one year so they're\n actually wearing a pad that's 91 so still nine percent were incontinent if you use two pads as your marker for incontinence so so our our rates of incontinence at least in uh 2009 at high volume centers was nine to sixteen percent at one year now you may get some improvement at time but that's you know that's a number that was there um from years ago so one year following a radical prostheticity what's your likelihood of delayed recovery of erectile function uh and urinary function or urinary control\n so if you have urinary uh control uh issues at uh at two years you've got a 30 like you have still getting some recovery of function if it you have it at three years it's 49 of uh of having uh um uh still having issues and if it's at 48 months it's 59 issues if we look at erectile function at 24 months uh you know you'll still have erectile dysfunction 22 percent of the time at 36 months uh 32 percent of time and 48 months you know still having issues with erectile function at 40 of the time\n all right so let's look at stress your icons and skin uh exfoliation so um uh this is a picture of the patient came in you know one week before his uh plan artificial sphincter uh surgery uh what we found is we had to cancel the surgery he had a severe yeast infection and had this reaction around uh there we had a secondary bacterial infection so we had to treat his skin and so we really have a program Trying to minimize some of this before we go into surgery uh ahead of time so what are our treatments for uh stress urine products\n so the area through observation to clamps to uh bulking agents to uh balloons and slings and sphinctures we'll go through these here so after prostatectomy and you have incontinence uh observation is reasonable concerning pelvic floor uh training is reasonable and uh the American neurologic Science student food Society uh give a moderate recommendations saying that's reasonable to do these and see if uh if you can help and so um oftentimes we recommend that most time you'll get that from your your uh\n your robotic surgeons or your oncologic surgeons we also recommend pads and clamps uh for this these are other options and this is what a peanut plant looks like I still have men come to see me who have been a content for uh 10 years and never heard of a clamp so I'm always happy if I can give a clamp to somebody or you know show them that and they say look doc that's all I need my life is better I'm good I mean my goal is not to do the most number of surgeries in the world it's really to try to help somebody uh have a better\n outcome and this is what the clamp looks like uh this is a Cunningham clamp you can get this on Amazon uh they're very easy to use and to try out and uh and I think it's worthwhile out to consider using even if you're early and after your prostate surgery to use it say when you're going to go to church you're going to go out to dinner or something so you have extra protection so you're not worried about leaking that give you some a sense of security all right so say you have incontinence\n after your your radical prostatectomy uh when should you have a procedure to help um so the American urologue say that if stress and confidence does not improve by 12 months uh then you know you you should then at that point consider therapy there's those of us who do this that if you have really severe incontinence say 10 12 pads a day and it's six months after the surgery we'll even talk about doing something sooner than that and uh and that's really just a discussion that you should have with uh with your your\n Urologic surgeon now um I would say just to off the cuff a lot of your oncology surgeons the guys who do your your uh your robotic surgery everybody tell you keep waiting you know it's going to get better give it time um but you know I'm not biased in that I'm going to tell you look you fall into this category it may be an advantage for you to think about it sooner to improve your quality of life if you wanted to do that but there's no you know nobody's dying for any planets so you can wait there's\n nothing that says you have to but I think we have ways to make that better uh should you choose all right this is a bulking agent just to show you how we do bulking agents this is uh the way that's oriented on the back of the screen is the bladder the urethra is coming towards us and that's a needle at five o'clock and what we do is we inject this material under the tissue and the line and create bulking and to close that that's a bulking agent to create closure and that works well in females like that pictures\n actually from female which I don't treat females anymore but that was for about 15 years ago and it can work well there but we actually recommend against it uh and men have had their prostate surgery it really doesn't work very well um I I can't think of anybody that ever did where they went gosh I am 100 better and happy there's a chance of making it worse and it may affect our surgeries when we go to repair that at a later date so really we recommend it against bulking agents at this time uh proact I\n don't have any experience with this yet I'm interested to learn about it but practice you place these little balloons up the bladder neck as long injection ports you can fill or decrease the volume to create compression of the bladder neck so when you look at it it's merely invasive you can adjust it afterwards which is attractive when you look at how dry were people after their procedure is only about 60 percent of patients were really dry and the revision rates were at 22 percent um and you know even up to 70 at four\n years and so right now there's not any official recommendation uh for against it though I think it's something to consider and keep an eye on that's the proact system so let's talk about the sling system we have so the current sling that we used uh most routinely is the advanced XP sling and this is a picture showing what this looks like uh there's a minor recommendation from the sufu and the AUA uh for this and what this is the mesh link that is fixed to the urethra reduce or a small incision below the scrotum\n and then this mesh is fixed to the urethra and then there's two small incisions on either side of the scrotum but we pull the mesh up to tighten it and so the way this works shows you a little cartoon of how we put it in so a little Trail car that we passed along the side of the scrotum and then the mesh looks like this it's the same mesh that we see with the females that you know the lawyers have uh the malpractice uh advertisements but for us we're putting it much deeper we don't have the same issues that we have in female so it\n is a safe product for men but this is what it looks like here's a an image showing what it looks like from the side so the urethra here is in blue the sling is in black and what you can see is as we pull this thing up we have a rotation of the urethra from where it sits rotating up into a higher position and we think a more anatomic position where we get better uh more anatomic length of the sphincter and so this is a drawing showing again if we blow this up from the side you'll see when this mesh right\n here if you can see my arrow is pulled up what that does is it rotates the urethra upward and then here at the bladder neck this is the length of the sphincter which is relatively short and then as we pull up on the on the sling the functional sphincter length now is longer and so again we think it repositions this finger to work in a better way and again that's similar thing here where you see that's the sling being tension up and now we see the what lengthening of that continence mechanism to give control\n and that was the male sling and so the artificial urinary sector is for more moderate or severe incontinence it can also be used for more myelincontes as well but if someone has a higher volume of incontinence than we think of the artificial urine sector and this really has been the gold standard We compare things with everything is compared about the slings and other devices that are out there you know we try to see what we can do here but when you look at outcomes there's a recent trial done called The Master's trial and I looked\n at you know sling versus the artificial sphincter and when you compare this thing to the artificial Center the sphincter had a greater Improvement in the overall quality of life scores that lower supported leakage and a lower mean pad rate use so this tends to be I think a really great treatment for those who have incontinence so we when we do an evaluation reconnaissance history and physical we have you bring in your pads not everybody does that we still find it helpful we'll weigh those pads for you to see what your how much you're leaking\n that period we do a system Austin which is a flexible scope to look in the urethra and we're looking at the coaptation or the closure of the sphincter we're looking for any starring or contractures in the bladder neck and then we do what's called a bedside uranavics we fill the bladder up and then we have you Bear Down coughs news we have certain Maneuvers and then we look and see how bad is that leaking and then that helps to put you in have us put you in a category of what may be the best treatment for you so here's just an\n image of a cystoscopy look in there and you can see where the that's the sphincter which looks pale and you can see a segment's missing it's just a it's a not a healthy looking uh sphincter and this little video of what is a coaptation of urethra and I'll show you this here it'll play Oh but what happened what happens is you'll see where the sphincter closes well and it will you'll see that you get a great great closure with that and that that closure is what you want to have uh uh to tell\n us that hey your sphincter works well so we do a sling that may be a reasonable choice for you uh this one here shows where they uh they can track down and really it almost opens a little bit and you'll sometimes see urine come out and so we see that that looks like a very poor contraction of a sinter that you know we give the rating a score out of five and the first one we would have given a four or five that last one to give it a you know one or two so again that helps us to predict are you going to be a better candida for a sling\n versus an artificial sphincter it's a patient who is set for surgery uh we're doing a system we saw this calcification at the bladder neck they did not have radiation so it wasn't it just trophic calcification we took him to the operating to look and see what's going on as we manipulated we found one of the clips from the prostate surgery and migrated into the anastomosis in order to remove that interesting this patient got better I mean I'm not sure why most men even if you're removed they still\n have incontinence but he got better so um we didn't have to do any other surgery on him but we'll look for those things to see if we can make anything better so with cystoscopy again we're looking for you know what type of uh uh what type of anatomy what time uh what type of look does that area um and we do a bedside uranetics from those who are a little bit maybe have neurologic issues or something that doesn't sound right in the story we'll do a standard or formal aerodynamics which is a look and see does the bladder\n have uh changes in there that are not normal that we may predict other issues that may need to be addressed but sometimes you'll hear a urologist may do urine outs but it's not standard for us all the time so we try to figure out who is the best-selling candidate so if I don't wanna if I want to sling or I don't have to pump or do anything uh sling candidates are those who have less leakage so if you have you know less than 200 a day and the less you're in the better if you have a good looking\n and functional stinker on cystoscopy and no no defects in the sphincter and if you've not had any prior urethral surgery or any bulking agents uh and no radiation therapy that gives us a better chance at having control uh with a sling and our success rates to that are really about 70 to 85 percent this light and those were porcelain candidates there for better artificial sphincter candidate are those who have the opposite they've got more than say you know 400 cc's of leaking per day they've\n got you know bad looking sphincter and they don't uh they leak very minimal Maneuvers uh they've had radiation therapy they're probably better candidates for an artificial urine sector and so to go that route and to compare the two so on the left side you think your right side is now sling um you know both are outpatient both have a fully catheter drenched bag overnight the artificial Sinker you need to pump it to work it the mouse thing you don't need to pump anything uh the sphincter is still we turn it on or\n delayed activation we turn on in about eight weeks the slang works right away so once that catheter comes out you find out did it work or not so you have that immediate gratification the artificial sphincture is probably better for severe stress incontinence and also you've had radiation therapy uh and it's MRI compatible success rates for the artificial spher about 80 to 90 percent for the male selling about 70 to 80 percent uh with a center you got to be careful to fully catheter if you ever go to the hospital again they could\n attachment of Catherine you have to have a deactivated usually by us for the mouse thing there's not a big deal that don't have to worry about that we have some different things we've used to try to minimize risks of issues of catheterization those patients that have the artificial sphincter artificial sphincter we've used a temporary tattoo that's worked well that was one of the Reps from many years ago a very great guy he came up with that temporary tattoo and our system we have a an alert\n so we put a diagnosis code in that says when you go to the our hospital system or in our Network this comes up that says you have an artificial sanctuary and cannot have a fully catheter because we have men who have this happen they go to the hospital they have a catheter put in and they have an erosion of this of a good sphincter that worked well and that's just an unfortunate thing so we've now employed this we've just gone to Epic we're trying to get this put in the Epic system as well so if one of my\n patients in Florida ends up saying Cleveland Ohio uh that that warning would fire in uh in their system as well so that wherever they go uh that's that's a warning for those health care workers do so treatment options for stress incontinence observation uh can do that but won't get any better over time typically bulking agents really less than 25 percent Improvement I think it's really lower than that the ball bar sling is uh you know 70 80 up to 85 Improvement and the artificial Sinker 80 to 90 Improvement uh and and again it's\n uh wide-ranging options treatment uh is oftentimes uh will help things rarely do they make anything worse uh so again it's relatively safe and we have high satisfaction rates for both um you know again men love these um if anything goes wrong in them they're calling us the next day saying hey can we how can we get these fixed [Music] thank you\nSUMMARY \nThe speaker is a urologist based in Orlando, Florida with a specialization in reconstructive urology, including
