{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among Canadian men, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer. Prostate cancer incidence increases almost exponentially with age; most cases are diagnosed in men aged 65 years or older. With the possible exception of animal fat consumption, no known widespread modifiable risk factors have been identified. Although the prognosis is good if appropriate treatment occurs in the early stages of disease, the ability of existing early detection techniques to decrease mortality has not yet been demonstrated.
