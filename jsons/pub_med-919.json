{"pageContent": "The aim of this article is to selectively review the current research findings related to quality of life and prostate cancer. English-language journals indexed in MEDLINE, PubMed, and CINAHL published between 1999 and 2005 were searched for relevant articles using the following keywords: \"quality of life and prostate cancer,\" \"prostatectomy,\" \"radiation therapy,\" \"brachytherapy,\" \"cryotherapy,\" or \"androgen deprivation therapy.\" References in selected articles were reviewed for potentially relevant articles not identified through database searches. All treatment modalities have a significant impact on quality of life for men with local or advanced prostate cancer. Alterations in sexual functioning cause the most significant impact on quality of life for men. Quality of life is decreased in both the short and long term for men with prostate cancer. Oncology nurses must be cognizant of the challenges that a diagnosis of prostate cancer presents to the man with prostate cancer and his partner. Patients should be fully informed of the potential for impact on quality of life with all treatment modalities, and the oncology nurse can play an important role in both providing this information and supporting the patient when quality of life is impacted.", "metaData": {"source": "Barriers to sexual recovery in men with prostate, bladder and colorectal cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32868190/"}}
