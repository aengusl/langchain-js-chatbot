{"pageContent": "Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been conventional treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer for more than 70 years. However, all patients eventually become castration-resistant and a significant proportion of life span is spent in the castration-resistant state. Prospective randomized control trials have incorporated early chemotherapy along with ADT based on the hypothesis that a significant level of resistance to ADT already exists in newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer and ADT exhibits synergistic antitumor activity with taxanes. We discuss the changing landscape of management of patients with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer based on recently published landmark randomized trials.", "metaData": {"source": "Expectant management: an option for localized prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16130016/"}}
