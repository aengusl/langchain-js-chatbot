{"pageContent": "Purpose: African-Americans have a higher age-adjusted incidence and a higher disease-specific mortality than whites. Two potential causes are differences in biology or socioeconomic status, the latter leading to differences in access, delivery, or utilization of health care. In this study, we compare serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels for comparable stage and grade-disease, as well as individual insurance status. PSA is a demonstrated indicator of the size and virulence of tumor and is correlated with prognosis. Insurance status has been linked with income and education and is an indicator of access to medical care.", "metaData": {"source": "Fear of cancer recurrence in patients undergoing definitive treatment for prostate cancer: results from CaPSURE\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14532810/"}}
