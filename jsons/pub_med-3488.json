The decision about choosing the right treatment has become pertinent for many patients. This literature review aimed to assess the current state-of-the-art regarding decisional aids and the associated decisional outcomes for the purpose of designing a method for both patients and doctors to use to make the best treatment decision for the patient. A literature search was conducted via MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases using the keywords \"prostate\" and \"cancer\" and \"impact\" and \"decisio*\" and \"treatment.\" Articles were included that focused on treatment outcomes, decision-making processes, and the use of decisional aids for localized prostate cancer. Articles that investigated prostate cancer in general or prostate cancer screening were excluded, as were articles that were not written in English. Altogether, 13 articles were finally critically reviewed for this study. Results were conflicting regarding the relations between patient factors, use of decisional aids, and decisional outcomes. There was a large gap in the literature regarding the optimal decision-making process for men with localized prostate cancer. The role of currently available decisional aids is limited to helping patients make the right decisions. There is a need to develop a novel decisional aid in which patient-physician discussion-involving evaluation of a spectrum of patient-, doctor-, and treatment-related factors-is included.", "metaData": {"source": "Adjustment and discussion of cancer: a comparison of breast and prostate cancer survivors\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25160575/"}}
