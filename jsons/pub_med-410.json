{"pageContent": "Objectives: Fiducial markers improve accuracy in external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for treatment of prostate cancer (PCa). However, many patients recur after EBRT necessitating additional treatment, such as MR-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation (TULSA). Residual markers may compromise TULSA through ultrasound field distortions and generation of local susceptibility artifacts. The objective was to investigate how markers affect the ablation outcome during clinical TULSA treatments.", "metaData": {"source": "Clinically significant urethral stricture and/or subclinical urethral stricture after high-intensity focused ultrasound correlates with disease-free survival in patients with localized prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21912100/"}}
