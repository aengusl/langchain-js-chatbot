{"pageContent": "Laparoscopic surgical techniques were originally applied to the staging of prostate cancer in the form of laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection. The efficiency of laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection has proven to be comparable to open lymphadenectomy in tissue yield and also shows a considerable decrease in postoperative morbidity. Subsequently, laparoscopy has been used as an adjuvant to perineal prostatectomy for preliminary dissection of the seminal vesicles. Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy has been performed but the long-term efficacy of this treatment is unknown at this point. Future clinical applications of laparoscopic surgical techniques in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer include harvesting of primary and metastatic prostatic tissue for adjuvant gene therapies for prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Maximal testosterone suppression in prostate cancer--free vs total testosterone\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24713136/"}}
