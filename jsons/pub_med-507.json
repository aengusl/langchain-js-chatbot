{"pageContent": "Objectives: To present our preliminary clinical results of transrectal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in Stage T1b-2N0M0 prostate cancer. Efforts are being made to provide minimally invasive alternative treatment options with equal efficacy and fewer side effects. HIFU delivers ultrasound energy with rapid thermal necrosis of tissue in the focal region without damaging the surrounding tissue.", "metaData": {"source": "[High intensity focused ultrasound for hemiablation of localized prostate cancer]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30178293/"}}
