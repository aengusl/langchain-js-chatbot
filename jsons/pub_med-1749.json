{"pageContent": "Sociodemographic and lifestyle factors may play a role in determining whether patients with clinically localized prostate cancer (PC) are managed with active surveillance (AS), radical prostatectomy (RP), or radiation therapy (RT); however, these relationships have not been well examined. In a cross-sectional study conducted within an equal access healthcare system, multivariable adjusted regression analysis revealed that living with a spouse or partner was associated with a 65% lower chance of being managed by RT (P = 0.001) and 57% lower risk of being managed by AS (P = 0.042) compared with RP. No other sociodemographic or lifestyle factors were independently associated with treatment modality.", "metaData": {"source": "Stem-cell therapy for erectile dysfunction\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28372281/"}}
