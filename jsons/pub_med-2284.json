Therefore, we aimed to clarify the anti-(18)F-FACBC transport mechanism in prostate cancer cells. We also studied the fate of anti-(18)F-FACBC after it is transported into cells.", "metaData": {"source": "[Quality of life in urologic oncology: new aspects]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14605454/"}}
