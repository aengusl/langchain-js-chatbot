{"pageContent": "The current treatment algorithms for management of localized prostate cancer are mainly extirpative in nature. Treatment varies from expectant management to radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy. However, the ever-increasing emphasis on achieving the best survival benefit while better preserving quality of life, coupled with the introduction of new, safer, and efficacious minimally invasive ablative technologies, has led to the increased popularity of minimally invasive treatment (MIT). MIT refers to the use of a wide range of techniques for local target ablation of the prostate gland with minimal damage to the surrounding tissue. Currently these include cryotherapy and high-intensity focused ultrasound. However, other experimental technologies such as photodynamic therapy, interstitial prostate brachytherapy, and microwave and radiofrequency interstitial tumor ablation are also currently under investigation in early clinical trials. To date, the overall interim results for these relatively new modalities of treatment appear comparable to those for surgical and radiation therapies. However, randomized, controlled studies are needed to support use of these modalities as an alternative to surgery and radiation. In this review, we will address the current rationale for and knowledge of MIT with regard to its safety and efficacy in the treatment of localized prostate cancer. In addition, we will discuss future promising tools in MIT such as photodynamic therapy and the target focal therapy approach as a new trend for the treatment of organ-confined low-volume disease.", "metaData": {"source": "First analysis of the long-term results with transrectal HIFU in patients with localised prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17997026/"}}
