{"pageContent": "Advanced prostate cancer patients frequently deal with intractable prostatic bleeding which is a difficult problem to manage. Intraurethral high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy may palliate this condition. Advanced prostate cancer patients with intractable prostatic bleeding were offered brachytherapy with Iridium-192 using a Micro-selectron HDR machine. During a 5-year period, analysis was performed in 23 patients with a median age and Gleason score of 78 years and 9, respectively. Following brachytherapy, haematuria resolved in 19 of the 23 patients and was recurrence free at 6 months. Intraurethral HDR brachytherapy is a potentially effective modality for treating haematuria in patients with advanced prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Cystic metastasis of prostate cancer: A case report\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30558081/"}}
