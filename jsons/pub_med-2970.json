{"pageContent": "With the advancement of early detection tools for prostate cancer and ability to better localize disease, there has been increased interest in focal or targeted therapies that carry less morbidity than traditional whole-gland treatments. The Sonablate\u00ae high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) device has Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(K) clearance in the United States for ablation of prostate tissue. HIFU utilizes an ultrasound (US) transducer that focuses US beams on a preset point as much as 4 cm from the energy source without injuring intervening tissue. The Sonablate system guides the surgeon step-by-step to perform effective ablation of a target lesion. The surgeon can assess treatment effect with tissue change monitoring, and care is taken to prevent rectal wall injury. We believe hemiablation is the most favorable focal HIFU treatment to optimize cancer control and minimize the side effects associated with whole gland therapy. We recommend considering HIFU ablation as an extension of active surveillance rather than definitive treatment. Further research on long-term oncologic and functional outcomes is warranted.", "metaData": {"source": "A chronological database to support outcomes research in prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12873669/"}}
