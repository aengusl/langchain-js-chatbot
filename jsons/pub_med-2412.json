{"pageContent": "Nanomechanical properties of living cells, as measured with atomic force microscopy (AFM), are increasingly recognized as criteria that differentiate normal and pathologically altered cells. Locally measured cell elastic properties, described by the parameter known as Young's modulus, are currently proposed as a new diagnostic parameter that can be used at the early stage of cancer detection. In this study, local mechanical properties of normal human prostate (RWPE-1) cells and a range of malignant (22Rv1) and metastatic prostate cells (LNCaP, Du145 and PC3) were investigated. It was found that non-malignant prostate cells are stiffer than cancer cells while the metastatic cells are much softer than malignant cells from the primary tumor site. Next, the biochemical properties of the cells were measured using confocal Raman (RS) and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopies to reveal these cells' biochemical composition as malignant transformation proceeds. Nanomechanical and biochemical profiles of five different prostate cell lines were subsequently analyzed using partial least squares regression (PLSR) in order to identify which spectral features of the RS and FT-IR spectra correlate with the cell's elastic properties. The PLSR-based model could predict Young's modulus values based on both RS and FT-IR spectral information. These outcomes show not only that AFM, RS and FT-IR techniques can be used for discrimination between normal and cancer cells, but also that a linear correlation between mechanical response and biomolecular composition of the cells that undergo malignant transformation can be found. This knowledge broadens our understanding of how prostate cancer cells evolve thorough the multistep process of tumor pathogenesis.", "metaData": {"source": "Metabolic effects of single-dose pamidronate administration in prostate cancer patients with bone metastases\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12521128/"}}
