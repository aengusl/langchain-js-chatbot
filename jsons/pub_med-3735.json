{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is the most prevalent cancer in men and can be managed effectively if diagnosed early and monitored. Currently, prostate-specific antigen testing in conjunction with a digital rectal exam has been utilized for screening at-risk men. However, the lack of specificity of prostate-specific antigen as a marker for prostate cancer combined with the asymptomatic and slow-growing nature of prostate tumors has resulted in many men being overdiagnosed and subjected to surgery or treatment with adverse side effects. The focus in the research community currently has been on discovering noninvasive surrogate markers such as proteins, circulating tumor cells and nucleic acids in the blood or urine of patients with prostate cancer. These markers, in combination with prostate-specific antigen, are providing promise that a personalized multiparametric approach to prostate cancer diagnosis and monitoring will aid in managing this disease.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer: current and evolving strategies\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8673658/"}}
