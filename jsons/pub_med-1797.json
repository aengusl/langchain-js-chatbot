{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among Nigerian men. The prevalence of PCa varies within Nigeria, with the highest prevalence of 1046 per 100,000 in men over the age of 40 reported in Lagos. Unfortunately, 40% of these men are diagnosed with locally advanced disease and 35% with metastatic disease. Given the ability to screen for PCa among high-risk individuals, late stage diagnosis of PCa could be potentially reduced through education of men so that they seek screening. Along these lines, it is important to assess a population's knowledge and awareness on PCa and screening. Our study addresses this issue by evaluating awareness and attitudes of Nigerian men in Abuja on PCa and screening. Our results revealed gaps in awareness and perception of susceptibility to PCa and low levels of PCa screening. Factors such as age, education level, and income affected PCa awareness. In conclusion, our study points to the need to educate younger men of lower education and socioeconomic status in Nigeria with the aim to increase screening and earlier detection of PCa.", "metaData": {"source": "Quality of life after prostate cancer treatments in patients comparable at baseline\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23612450/"}}
