{"pageContent": "Localized cancer of the prostate can be treated by radical prostatectomy, external beam irradiation, or radioactive implantation with similar survival results. Radical prostatectomy, however, almost universally results in impotency, although a new, nerve-sparing procedure may preserve potency in B1 patients. External beam irradiation radiates a large volume of tissue with significant rectal and bladder morbidity, 23-47% risk of impotency, and requires prolonged treatment (6-8 weeks). Radioactive implantation may be done suprapubically or transperineally using iodine-125, gold-198, or radon-222 permanent implantation techniques and iridium-192 or radium-226 removable implantation techniques. Interstitial iodine-125 implantation is frequently employed since it is a short procedure and limits the morbidity to a 7% incidence of impotency, 20% urinary complications, and 5% rectal complications. The overall 5-year survival of patients with iodine-125 is 79%, the survival rate decreasing with increasing T or N stage or increasing grade of tumor.", "metaData": {"source": "General quality of life 2 years following treatment for prostate cancer: what influences outcomes?
