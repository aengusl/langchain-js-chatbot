{"pageContent": "This paper describes the optimization of designing a two-dimensional (2-D) ultrasound phased array to be used for the treatment of both prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The optimization study took into consideration the physical constraints of the conventional method of treatment, and arrived at an optimized array design with the overall dimensions of 10 cm x 2.2 cm. The optimization study also addressed the following additional parameters: The maximum possible depth of penetration (DOP), the maximum possible steering angle, the Grating lobe level, the operating frequency, and the element size. In optimizing the design, the DOP and the steering angle are maximized while the grating lobe value is minimized. A 56 x 12 element 2-D array was found to be the optimum choice allowing both focusing and steering within the entire prostate without inducing damage at locations other than that of the focal point.", "metaData": {"source": "High Intensity Focused Ultrasound for Radiorecurrent Prostate Cancer: A North American Clinical Trial\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28652121/"}}
