{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer treatment is a controversial topic amongst physicians and patients alike. Radical therapies such as prostatectomy and whole gland radiation offer the best outcomes in terms of oncologic efficacy, but the decision to undergo treatment must be weighed against its potential morbidity. Over the past decade, the concept of focal therapy for prostate cancer has been introduced as a potential method of achieving oncologic control with a lesser degree of morbidity. Focal therapy refers to isolated ablation of a tumor focus with sparing of uninvolved, surrounding tissue. While it remains in the early stages of development, considerable research is underway that will help determine the optimal method of achieving this goal. Current areas of investigation include appropriate candidate selection, lesion identification, modality of treatment, and follow-up strategies.", "metaData": {"source": "High-intensity focused ultrasound as salvage therapy for patients with recurrent prostate cancer after radiotherapy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24578803/"}}
