{"pageContent": "Purpose: The overall purpose of this preliminary study to a clinical trial is to explore the feasibility of recruiting men receiving androgen ablation therapy (AAT) for locally advanced prostate cancer to a future strength training study for the prevention of osteoporosis. The threefold specific purpose of this comparative and correlational study is to (a) describe the prevalence of risk factors for osteoporosis, (b) compare functional status and symptom distress between those interested and not interested in a future strength training study, and (c) examine relationships among self-efficacy for strength training, functional status, symptom distress, years since cancer diagnosis, and cumulative dose of AAT in this at-risk population.", "metaData": {"source": "Use of combined scanning electrochemical and fluorescence microscopy for detection of reactive oxygen species in prostate cancer cells\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24044675/"}}
