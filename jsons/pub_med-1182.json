{"pageContent": "The objective of this study is to compare the quality of life (QOL) outcomes between laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Between July 2007 and July 2013, 229 patients with localized prostate cancer underwent LRP while 105 patients with localized prostate cancer underwent RARP between December 2012 and August 2014. We evaluated their QOL using the 8-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-8) and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index of Prostate (EPIC) questionnaires at preoperative and at postoperative 3, 6 and 12 months. In the LRP and RARP groups, over 80 and 90% of patients answered questionnaires at each follow-up time, respectively. At baseline QOL of EPIC and SF-8, there was no significant difference between LRP and RARP groups. At postoperative 3 months, Physical and Mental Components of SF-8 and Urinary Summary (U), all Urinary Subscales, Sexual Function and Bowel Function of EPIC showed significantly better scores in RARP group than in LRP group. At postoperative 6 and 12 months, there were no differences between LRP and RARP groups in terms of all QOL scores. RARP group showed better scores in SF-8 as well as urinary and sexual function of EPIC at postoperative-3 months. These differences disappeared at postoperative 6 and 12 months.", "metaData": {"source": "Men's help-seeking in the first year after diagnosis of localised prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27111695/"}}
