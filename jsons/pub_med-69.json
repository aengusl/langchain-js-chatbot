{"pageContent": "High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a heat based energy source used for tissue ablation. HIFU has several clinical applications and prostate cancer ablation is one of the uses that have been explored for more than a decade. Focal therapy is an alternative treatment option for selected patients with low/intermediate PCa, that is based on complete ablation of tumor within the prostate with preservation of normal parenchyma and better preservation of Genitourinary functions. In spite of PCa being predominantly a multi-centric disease, it is postulated that a specific dominant (large volume) 'index lesion' dictates the biological behavior of the cancer and subsequent lethality of the disease. The use of HIFU for focal ablation of PCa, have demonstrated satisfactory cancer control with fewer morbidity and better preservation of continence and erection. The aim of this article is to present the readers with a brief review of the principles, devices available for clinical uses, published clinical experience and future directions and research opportunities in focal HIFU ablation of prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "[Transrectal high-intensity focused ultrasound for local treatment of prostate cancer. 2009 Update]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19455298/"}}
