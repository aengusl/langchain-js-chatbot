{"pageContent": "Background: Prostate specific antigen kinetics (PSAK) including prostate specific antigen velocity (PSAV) and PSA doubling time (PSADT) are used as predictors of prostate cancer (PCa) therapeutic outcome, disease prognosis, and cancer-specific mortality. However controversy persists regarding use of these parameters in cancer detection. Our aim is to evaluate PSAV as a predictor of PCa and intermediate/high grade PCa (HGPCa).", "metaData": {"source": "Prostatic cancer surveillance following whole-gland high-intensity focused ultrasound: comparison of MRI and prostate-specific antigen for detection of residual or recurrent disease\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22253342/"}}
