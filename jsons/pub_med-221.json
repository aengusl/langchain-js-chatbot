{"pageContent": "The study was aimed to the assessment of the effectiveness of treatment for prostate cancer using high-intensity focused ultrasound on the basis of clinical, radiation, laboratory data, and results of morphometric and immunohistochemical study of postoperative prostate biopsies. 112 sessions of HIFU-ablation of the prostate in 112 patients with localized prostate cancer were performed. Average number of impulses of action--634 +/- 176, the average volume of tissue exposed--34.6 +/- 15.2 cm3 per 1 session. The operative time ranged from 90 to 165 min (mean 125 min). The postoperative hospital stay ranged from 7 to 14 days (average 10 +/- 0.8 days). Intraoperative complications during HIFU-ablation were not observed. The average level of prostate-specific antigen 1,5 months after surgery was 0.7 (0.12-3.67) ng/ml. Minimum level of prostate-specific antigen was reached 20 +/- 2 weeks after treatment, and the average level was 0.26 +/- 0.01 ng/ml. 6 months after, prostate volume decreased by an average of 49%; 10-12 months after intervention, prostate volume was 6.5 +/- 2.2 cm3. Morphological analysis after treatment included studies with standard and immunohistochemical staining using the following antibodies: PCNA, Bcl2, AMACR, E-cadherin, ANDR. Recurrence-free course was observed in 96 (85.8%) patients. Recurrences were detected in 16 (14.2%) patients, with biochemical progression in 11 (9.82%) patients. Local recurrence (morphologically confirmed) was diagnosed in 5 (4.46%) patients.", "metaData": {"source": "Transrectal-HIFU as primary minimally-invasive option for localized prostate cancer.
