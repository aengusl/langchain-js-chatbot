{"pageContent": "Patients with prostate carcinoma paradoxically have both a hypercoagulable state and a bleeding diathesis. Hypercoagulability manifested by venous and arterial thrombosis has been documented in several large clinical trials. However, many investigators have reported a high risk of postoperative bleeding in prostate cancer patients. Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy has also been commonly noted at different clinical stages of this indolent cancer. In this article we review clinical, laboratory, and experimental evidence for abnormalities of various components of the coagulation and plasminogen pathways and analyze their contribution in prostate cancer growth, progression, and angiogenesis. Finally, we propose potential therapeutic antiangiogenic strategies in patients with prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Treat the mind, not just the body for prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36104411/"}}
