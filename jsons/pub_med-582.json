{"pageContent": "Introduction and objective: Partial gland ablation (PGA) for localised prostate cancer (CaP) aims to eradicate clinically significant tumours while preserving healthy tissue, thereby decreasing the likelihood of side effects compared to whole-gland approaches. Although salvage radical prostatectomy (sRP) is a well-described salvage option in cases of PGA failure, the evidence supporting salvage PGA (sPGA) is limited. We hereby report the oncologic and functional outcomes of patients treated with sPGA following initial treatment with primary PGA (pPGA).", "metaData": {"source": "The utility of PSA velocity in prediction of prostate cancer and high grade cancer after an initially negative prostate biopsy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24038200/"}}
