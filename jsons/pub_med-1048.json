{"pageContent": "Many patients with prostate cancer for whom androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is indicated are young and desire to remain sexually active. In such patients, the side effects of androgen therapy on sexual function can be a source of serious reduction in overall quality of life. Providing the appropriate treatment options in this patient population is therefore essential. Nevertheless, treating such patients is challenging and an understanding of the underlying mechanisms of sexual physiology and pathophysiology is crucial to optimal patient care.
