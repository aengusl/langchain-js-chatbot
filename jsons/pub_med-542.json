{"pageContent": "Objectives: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics have failed to predict for the presence of prostate cancer in screening populations in which many patients harbor subclinical disease. We hypothesized that the prebiopsy PSA doubling time (PSADT) and PSA velocity (PSAV) could predict for cancer detection in a referral population with a suspicion of prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "High-intensity focused ultrasound therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16847468/"}}
