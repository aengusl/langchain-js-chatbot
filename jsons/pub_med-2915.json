{"pageContent": "Purpose: Prostate cancer represents a disease with diverse clinical outcomes. Treatment strategies that optimize benefit and minimize morbidities depend on accurate estimates of disease status and likelihood of progression. Emerging technologies capable of qualitatively and quantitatively profiling genes expressed by neoplastic tissues may provide insights into tumor behavior. This review discusses the use of microarray based transcript expression profiling to stratify human cancers into risk categories.", "metaData": {"source": "Substance use disorder and its effects on outcomes in men with advanced-stage prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25042396/"}}
