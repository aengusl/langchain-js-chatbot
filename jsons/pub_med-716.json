{"pageContent": "A measure of focusing efficiency is introduced for high-intensity, focused ultrasound (HIFU). The measure consists of the fraction of the total acoustic power emitted that linearly propagates through a circle located at the focus. The medium is absorption-free water, and power is computed using pressure and the normal component of velocity. 3 MHz phased-array designs involving different element layouts and curvatures are placed in square apertures of length 2.2 cm. The acoustic fields of these devices then are propagated to on-axis foci. The resulting focal efficiencies then are calculated using a two wavelength (0.1 cm) radius circle. Among these array designs, an annular array with 27 wavelength-wide rings then is extended to be the basis of a twin phased-array device for prostate hyperthermia treatment. The two annular arrays are attached to door-like hinges to allow for joint two-dimensional focusing. The focusing efficiency of this device then is compared to rectangular element-array devices with the same 5.4 by 2.2 cm source extent. With the addition of absorption and finite-amplitude distortion, the heating rate and temperature rise produced by the twin annular device in prostate tissue is considered. As a final look at the potential of annular array-based designs, three larger 2 MHz devices are briefly considered for abdominal treatment.", "metaData": {"source": "Effect of endocrine treatment on voiding and prostate size in men with prostate cancer: a long-term prospective study\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22150564/"}}
