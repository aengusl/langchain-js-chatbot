Recent understanding of pelvic anatomy and improvement in surgical technique have substantially reduced its morbidity. Early recovery of urinary continence is possible and improvement of sexual function after surgery may be enhanced by use of sildenafil and nerve reconstructive surgery. As prostate cancer is increasingly diagnosed at early stages and therefore with more favorable survival outcomes, the basis on which patients select primary therapy has shifted toward considerations of health-related quality of life. Accordingly, QOL assessment has become an important form of outcomes based research that may weigh heavily on the treatment selection by patients.", "metaData": {"source": "[Comparison of functional outcomes after retropubic and robot-assisted radical nerve-sparing prostatectomy conducted by surgeons with total caseloads of over 1000 prostatectomies]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28394523/"}}
