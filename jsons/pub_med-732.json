{"pageContent": "Currently, the active surveillance of men with favorable intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer (PCa) is a longstanding controversy, in terms of their oncological outcomes, and radical prostatectomy would constitute a similar concern of overtreatment, regarding its functional outcomes. Thus, focal therapy could be considered in men belonging to favorable intermediate-risk group. Among all focal therapies, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) was the most studied methodology in clinical trials. Although HIFU provided better functional outcomes than radical prostatecomy, the oncological outcomes were inferior in men with intermediate-risk localized PCa. Two articles have been published discussing the feasibility and clinical outcomes of robot-assisted partial prostatectomy (RAPP), and both the functional and oncological outcomes were superior than those with HIFU. However, the rate of positive surgical margins (PSMs) was reported as high in the literature. Here, we present a case of favorable intermediate-risk localized PCa with an isolated tumor at the anterior apex. After reconstructing a personal three-dimensional (3D) image, we utilized it in a 3D image-guided precise excise, followed by intraoperative frozen specimen review. We found that this method may present a resolution to the high PSM rate documented in the current literature regarding RAPP. This method merits further study with a well-designed prospective study.", "metaData": {"source": "[Bloodless prostate treatment using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8830396/"}}
