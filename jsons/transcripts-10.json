{"pageContent": " foreign I'd like to thank you all for inviting me to speak once again um I really enjoy speaking at the pcri conferences this is the one venue that I really enjoy participating in because I do believe that this has been a very highly beneficial forum for patients with Advanced prostate cancer um so for me it's been a very gratifying experience uh as part of today's of um presentation I'll be talking about Leticia which is a new agent that has been approved by the FDA for treatment of advanced prostate cancer and I'm\n going to give this talk kind of in the context of part four of my DIY combat manual for beating prostate cancer this is an extension of the talk I gave last year and it may be useful for some people who are viewing this to go back in time and look at last year's presentation if there are questions or things that don't make sense hopefully I'll be able to get this get through this talk in a fairly clear fashion so this is part four 177 psma Leticia also known as plavikto once again I'd like to remind everyone\n that one of the main reasons that I give these talks is as a way of honoring all the patients that have cared for over a time including many men who have died for from prostate cancer I do take these losses very personally and uh I do understand that these people that we lose to prostate cancer are friends and Sons and soul mates and husbands and fathers and I want them to always know that they are dearly missed by their family members and even our care team so I also have to provide disclosure Dr Quan and the Mayo Clinic\n have received licensing payments for pd-1 and pdl1 immunotherapy related intellectual properties over time and then I also want to make it very clear that I do read the little comments under all of my previous presentations and I try to remain sensitive to concerns or criticisms that people write in regarding past presentations that I've given one comment that came in previously was um kind of a statement that my presentations maybe don't give enough credit to other people in regards to where our Technologies come from who are the\n scientists and the Physicians that are moving these things forward specifically today we'll be talking about 177 PSA leticium and this is a technology that was really born out of the efforts of brilliant Physicians and scientists in Germany and Australia so I want to acknowledge that fact this is not necessarily stuff that we raised in our own backyard here but this this technology really does represent the very hard work of very very amazing scientists and Physicians overseas um and in many regards the US is just\n catching up to where many of these countries have been for a number of years now so um I also want to acknowledge one final thing and that is that my talk is geared mostly to us audience because this talk is being triggered by the FDA approval of 177 PSA Leticia as a treatment agent in the United States okay so the FDA approved 177 psma latissium on March 22nd or 23rd of 2022 this year another name for this agent is pluvicto so the question is what what is 177 psma latician so in order to understand what this agent is and how it works we first have\n to understand that some prostate cancer cells or many prostate cancer cells will have a little flag or a protein on their surface and it's called prostate specific membrane antigen this little protein can be imaged using a pet scanner which will show which cells or tumors Express the little flag or protein prostate specific membrane engine also known as psma so here's an individual that has metastatic prostate cancer within the body and all of these little tumors have this little flag on the surface that can\n be seen by a pet scanner that is designed to identify whether or not these tumor cells have prostate specific membrane antigen on their surface 177 psma latissium is a new drug that was developed that can stick to this little flag or protein called prostate specific membrane antigen the reason this is important is 177 PS or 177 luticium is an isotope that gives off radiation and once it sticks to the flag which is on the surface of the cell the cell gets irritated and swallows it kind of like if you've ever seen a frog\n swallowing a fly it'll literally just swallow it or internalize the isotope once the isotope is inside the cell it does its work by emitting beta radiation and this results in the kill off of the cell as well as cells that are in proximity to the cell that swallowed the 177 lutition so just by watching that little cartoon I think you can start to visualize why this is a very attractive therapy because it's a form of therapy that is very specific for prostate cancer and it's very effective and it actually\n kills cells it doesn't suppress them so understandably there's great interest in receiving 177 PSA Leticia if you are a patient with Advanced prostate cancer so the next question is in the United States who is eligible for treatment with 177 PSA Leticia so in order to get 177 PSA Leticia minion in the United States you have to meet four criteria you have to have metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer you have to have metastases that Express psma on the surface prostate specific membrane antigen\n you have to have been treated with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor and you have to be treated or have been treated with taxing based chemotherapy so let's take these criteria Point by point number one hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer what is that so as I talked about last year there are two types of prostate cancer when it comes to hormone responses hormone therapy responses the first type of prostate cancer is hormone-sensive prostate cancer specifically this is a form of cancer that you can treat with some hormone\n therapy like Lupron or orgovix or something like this to reduce testosterone in the body which then causes the cells to shrink which then lowers the PSA in the body so that's hormone sensitive prostate cancer in contrast hormone resistant prostate cancer or castrate resistant prostate cancer is a form of cancer that when you treat it with hormone therapy such as Lupron eleguard or govix whatever once you treat with hormone therapy testosterone goes down but the tumor keeps growing because it's no longer dependent on the presence of\n testosterone and this tumor can then send off metastes and the potasses can all grow and the PSA is going up even while you're on hormone therapy so the signature of hormone refractory prostate cancer is PSA is rising while you're being treated with a primary hormone form primary form of hormone therapy such as bilateral orchiectomy which is testicular removal treatment with Lupron elegard zolodex fermagon orgovix case of X all of these medications that basically knock out testosterone or mitigate against\n testosterone utilization in the body so what is a metastasis well prostate cancer is like dandelion this was from last year's talk when you treat prostate cancer even if you treat it it can send seeds to the rest of the body and every one of these seeds can grow another tumor and these are called metastasis or metastases and that sounds a little bit like metasta seeds that's a little of my humor so anyway at any rate all of these sites of new cancer growth are called metastases and every one of these sites can\n manufacture PSA and make the PSA go up in the body and every one of these sites is prostate cancer okay so this is what or these are what metastes are in the context of prostate cancer so in summary in order to meet the Criterion of hormone refractory methodic prostate cancer you have to have metastases that are hormone refractory in other words they don't respond to hormone therapy so that's number one number two this is where things get a little bit trickier and this is one of the reasons that I thought it would be\n useful to give this presentation because it's even been confusing for myself and it's created great anxiety to figure out what this all means metastases that Express prostate specific membrane engine what does that mean well what it means is that you have to be able to see the cancer and the metastes inside a psma PET scan this is where it gets confusing however in December of last year the FDA approved a gallium 68 psma PET scan but then in May of 2021 the FDA approved nf-18 psma PET scan for evaluation of psma positive prostate\n cancer and then in March of this year the FDA approved another gallium psma PET scan and this one's owned by Novartis and this one was basically described as an Imaging agent that would be useful for evaluation of patients with NASDAQ disease for whom 177 psma therapy might be indicated so what does that all mean well basically those statements or those approvals pertain to two different forms of pet scanning one is called a gallium psma pet scan and one is an F-18 psma PET scan and here are is his one individual that\n was first image with gallium and then the next day imaged with F-18 psma PET scan and other than maybe crispness of the image there's really not a lot of difference between these two scans at least by my inspection and inspection of a lot of the nuclear medicine experts here at our institution so why is this all important well it's important because the presence of these two different forms of pet scanning has created lots of confusion did I get the right PET scan can you tell if I should have gotten this pet scan or this our PET scan\n the answer to that is thus far it remains largely unknown if type of psma pet scan or PET Imaging used to assess patient leads to substantive differences in the effectiveness of 177 PSA leticium treatment outcomes okay so thus far we don't know if a gallium psma head scan works better than an F-18 psma pet scan in determining who's going to respond to the treatment 177 PS mailitium so that's why this is so confusing overseas I can tell you that they're largely agnostic or indifferent to what kind of pet scanning you have\n so overseas 177 psma latissium is given to all patients with psma positive disease irrespective of type of psma pet scan that was used to image the patient prior to therapy at present most experts in the United States do not anticipate that there's going to be a big difference in treatment outcome with 177 PSA leticiaum treatment for patients who were screened with gallium versus F-18 Imaging okay so I think we're all cool with that thus far however and this is where the confusion comes from different insurance providers May\n specify or specifically require either a gallium or an F-18 psma PET scan for assessment of patients with Advanced prostate cancer before authorizing 177 psma latissium treatment so now you can see why we are all a little bit in a panic because some insurance providers will say oh that's good enough other ones will say no you didn't get the right one etc etc etc so a little a lot of anxiety there um and a lot of questions about that in addition to add to the confusion even more not all institutions have both a gallium\n and F-18 psma pet scan in their Arsenal so some institutions can only provide one other institutions can only provide the other and then when you start doing this thing with did you get the right scan for the right insurance provider so forth and so on things get very confident complicated and patients get very anxious and a lot of doctors are waving their hands and they don't have all the answers to why there's confusion and how to resolve the confusion or address the confusion so that's why I thought that this was a\n very important discussion to have with regards to 177 psma leticium in short getting any form of psma pet scan prior to potential treatment with 177 psma latissium will not likely impact the therapeutic effectiveness of this treatment but it could lead to major delays in treatment and or possible failure of insurance providers to authorize or pay for therapy so that's why this is very important and of course after going through all of this the phrase that goes through my mind comes out of Wizard of Oz lions and tigers and bears oh my okay\n very very frightening it even gets more complicated because even if you have psma on the surface of your tumor and even though it is present you may not be eligible for treatment so gallium or F-18 psma pet images are scored at our institution to identify which Advanced prostate cancer patients can receive 177 psma latissium and scoring of a psma pet image is basically an assessment of the brightness or intensity of the lesions on the scan so scores typically range from a brightness intensity value of zero which\n means no intensity that'd just be a black spot you can't see up to three or four which is high intensity I actually asked our nuclear medicine specialist what's the difference between three or four and it was a little bit complicated to understand for me but it did remind me of volume 11 on an amplifier in the movie spinal tap I'm really curious how many people are going to understand that reference at any rate very bright is three to four very dark is zero or one at our institution currently scores of two three or four\n qualify a patient for treatment scoring of these spots however is somewhat subjective and has not been perfected and then on top of it we still don't know how to treat patients with mixed psma Expressions so this guy has some three but he also has some one so should he be treated she not be treated will it work won't it work we don't know it's also unknown if a low score might increase over time or after various forms of therapy so if you had a scan in February of this year and you had a score of one what if you\n repeat the scan could you have a score of three and then qualify we don't have all the answers my hunch is that some patients have low scores initially may have sufficient scores qualify for treatment later on so you shouldn't give up it's also unknown why some patients with high expression levels do not respond well to therapy and I think that Dr Jeff Johnson who is brilliant in this area has already touched upon this subject a little bit and we might expound on that in a little bit so I guess the question is could we\n possibly make this whole issue of psma pet scanning and scoring and everything a little bit more complicated and I think the answer is probably no so Point number three a patient has to have been treated with Androgen receptor pathway inhibition so even I had to ask what the heck that meant because I thought hormone therapy is Androgen receptor pathway inhibition and hormone therapy is but this is they're specifically specifically referring to use of second generation forms of hormone therapy that are listed\n here so second generation hormone therapy is itiga abiaderone extandi which is enzolutamide or leader which is apollutamide nubecca nubequa which is deruluthamide in order to qualify for treatment with 177 PS mail leticium you have to have either failed one of these agents not all of them just one or you need to be receiving active therapy with one of these agents and then you can move forward with 177 PSA latissium treatment there are some reports that I've heard here and there that say oh well you should take these medications because\n they will facilitate a better response by 177 PSA leticium I caution you about that because some of these claims are not well established and have come out of small reports so there's no locked in stone recommendations regarding whether you should take these things and there's certainly no statements that say you got to take this medication in order to get a better response from 177 psma Leticia so the fourth point that a patient has to meet in order to get 177 PSA Leticia his treatment with either dose of tax or\n bad taxol taxed here at Jeff Tana chemotherapy these are called taxing base forms forms of chemotherapy now in order to understand what that means you have to go back to the FDA indication label which was put out for approval of 177 psma laticium specifically 177 psma Leticia plavico should be given to patients with metastatic disease castrate resistant who have been treated with Androgen receptor pathway inhibition and taxing based chemotherapy so what does that mean this includes patients who have previously received taxing-based\n chemotherapy this includes patients who did not tolerate taxing based chemotherapy for every any reason this also includes patients who are currently receiving taxing base chemotherapy but it's not working but this label indication does not mandate that a patient fails tax same-based chemotherapy and I think that there's confusion out there and some patients are hearing I can't get Leticia because I didn't fail chemotherapy therefore they're pouring chemotherapy in me until I fail that's not right and\n it's important because if a patient receives too much chemotherapeutic treatment prior to treat treatment with 177 psma luticium you can damage the bone marrow to the extent that you cannot get treatment with 177 psma latician so all you have to remember is you have to have been treated with taxing based chemotherapy previously but you don't necessarily have to be actively failing it in order to qualify for this therapy and the reason this is important too is some insurance providers are saying well I'm\n not going to let this guy get 177 PSA Leticia because you can still give chemotherapy over and over again it hasn't failed well that's not a good idea um and I wanted to put some clarification out there regarding this additional considerations you have to remember everyone has to remember that 10 to 20 percent of patients will not have sufficient psma on the surface of their disease and therefore will not qualify for treatment well 177 psma latissium or patients may have other reasons that they can't\n receive therapy patients should be in reasonable Health at the time of treatment e-cog performance score zero to two ideally with a hemoglobin of eight platelet count of 75 000 white blood cell count of 2.5 and kidney function of 50 ml per minute for GFR The Experience today most of our patients have been treated with up to six cycles of treatment with 177 psma latissium given at six week intervals this is an average patient receiving treatment this is after two cycles of treatment PSA start at 13 went down to\n 0.65 I should say this is an average favorable response to treatment it's hard to average across all treatments and we'll talk about that but you can see the psma positive disease is disappearing PSA is going down everything's looking good these are gross generalizations about 50 of patients with ex will experience a 50 decline in PSA about a third of the patients will have a fantastic response a third of patients will have a mixed response that's kind of um and you know good and bad and about\n third of the patients will have no response and that's tragic a reduction in serum PSA of greater than 50 percent after the first treatment cycle probably probably indicates a very good response therapy in contrast no reduction in certain PSA after two cycles of therapy will likely portend a poor response to therapy and I got this information from our collaborators and Friends overseas who have quite a bit of experience with treating patients with 177 psma latissium we don't know about the durability of\n treatment overall we've had some patients have lasted up to three years without much disease coming back the majority of patients however have failed or start start to exhibit signs of disease recurrence before three years out from treatment the published median overall survival for patients receiving 177 psma latissium for advanced disease is 15.\n 3 months versus 11.3 months for patients tree with standard of care a little bit difference in overall survival but we have to remember that this is based on fairly minimalistic levels of standard of care this doesn't mean that overall you're going to last this long after treatment with 177 psma Leticia or even standard of care therapy all right 177ps my summary is 177 psma Leticia is a novel exciting wonderful treatment but it's not a miracle cure it should be viewed as one tool in the Arsenal of treating or combating\n Advanced prostate cancer just one tool and it's going to be used smartly in the context of everything else that's out there in terms of side effects the most common side effect is fatigue dry mouth we've seen a lot of nausea usually about three days after treatment sometimes the nausea can be fairly severe um there's some anemia some decreased appetite constipation about 20 percent of patients the most common laboratory abnormality and 30 of patients decreased lymphocyte counts decreased hemoglobin decreased\n white blood cells decreased platelets and some decrease in calcium and sodium also the FDA warns that you could have long-term damage from radiation exposure from a drug like this that could lead to bone marrow dysfunction and kidney failure late radiation side effects are unknown for this agent because there has not been sufficient follow-up guidance for patients in general when they come to get treated by us this is the guidance we provide for three days after therapy drink lots of water wash everything through your system\n preferably don't be drinking eight glasses of beer or something to wash it out of your system non-alcoholic beverages are preferable for the first day after therapy use separate bathroom facilities whenever possible men should sit down on the toilet to avoid splashing a urine which could have radioactivity in it all over the place clean up spilled urine by yourself flush the toilet twice if possible for three days after therapy any soiled waste that gets contaminated with your body fluid should be kept separate and\n safely away for 70 days so that the levels of radiation can return to normal Baseline levels in a safe place of storage um you got to keep the garbage and everything away from pets and children because they can become contaminated with radiation do not be closer than an arm's length from Children of 10 years or less for an extended period of time on the first day after therapy for two days after therapy sleep in a separate bed from your partner especially if they are pregnant otherwise it's safe to share a bed when our person if they are\n not pregnant or less than 10 years of age you may return to work after treatment unless you don't want to return to work of course for six months after therapy you should not father a child you may travel home by car or plane immediately after therapy you may stay in the hotel the night of treatment patients who have received radioactive medication should be warned that they can set off radiation sensitivity detectors at airports border crossings and other security checkpoints and this has definitely happened to quite a few of\n our patients and it is amazing from what distance you can be detected with a security detector at a place like an airport and it can be quite unpleasant to have security guards coming after you if you are setting off their radiation alarms other questions regarding Leticia treatment and I'm sure Dr Moya and I will talk about some of these so I'll speed through this latitium re-treatment after six Cycles is possible you can get this treatment after treatment radium 223 you can access this treatment overseas they have great experience\n overseas and they have different restrictions regarding treatment concurrent use of drugs the one drug that we take patients off of while receiving treatment tends to be olaparib or limparza the parp Inhibitors are thought to be radio sensitizers and if you stay on them they could mix with the latitium to cause adverse side effects against the bone marrow and cause other problems so we tend to hold a laprib um for three days prior and three days after treatment with 177 psma laticium other therapies we stop immunotherapy uh\n two weeks before treatment we hold chemotherapy for one month before treatment with 177 PS male tissue the question of using you can use radiation in combination with 177 PSA latissim sometimes we'll shoot hot spots that are not responding but you have to do it cautiously and you have to use a radiation oncologist that's very experienced with this kind of situation predictors of response we don't have good predictors of response but we're working on that bigger spots of cancer tend to be more\n refractory treatment to treatment compared to smaller lesions so a lot of times we'll use radiation to knock out the really big lesions prior to treatment with 177 PSA leticium PSA zero so PSA zero is a situation where the blood PSA is zero your serum PSA zero so you think you wouldn't have any cancer in the body and we've shown what choline pet scanned at about 12 percent of our patients actually have metastatic disease even when the PSA is zero well we've accidentally also found that you can\n have a PSA of zero and still have a heck of a lot of psma positive mastak disease in the body even though the serum PSA is saying there's no cancer there so this is something that we're going to have to think about as we move forward if a patient doesn't respond well to Leticia we also use other forms of Imaging to see why that is some patients will have a mixture of psma positive disease and psma negative disease in the body which explains why only part of the disease is going away whereas the other\n parts of the disease are progressing and that's where we use these other forms of PET Imaging clinical trials there's clinical trial for everything right now every combination of latissium with every combination of drug some of them are good clinical trials some of them are kind of not very thoughtful and some I don't think are going to really answer very useful questions but there's a lot of clinical trials on 177 psma latissium future Isotopes there's a really hot future isotope and that's not a Pun It's\n called actinium 225 it's much more powerful than leticiaum but it's also got the kick to it it's got side effects and it can be effective for patients that have not responded to Leticia here's an example of one of our patients he got four cycles of leticium he wasn't responding his PSA was actually going up we pivoted we asked for octinium overseas patient was treated with actinium two cycles as PSA went from 172 down to 13.\n 3 we think it's because the actinium has deeper penetrants in the tumor more powerful effects for from against the tumor and we are excited that the possibility that actinium will one day soon be approved for the management Advanced prostate cancer to go up against or with latissium for the treatment of patience finally um the last thing I want to say is this has been a very anxious process uh not only for patients I mean I've I know that patients suffered a lot through the pro through the process of the rollout of the Leticia and I think there's lack\n confusion and I think there's a lot of anxiety and there's a lot of things we still don't know I myself have felt that this has been a very anxious period in my career I and I obviously don't have all the answers to everything obviously um the one thing I do want to point out though is it is new and it's exciting this new technology represents a sea change in which it's no longer just Urology it's no longer medical oncology that's driving the care of advanced prostate cancer several years ago I was\n asked to give a talk at the Society of abdominal Imaging and I said my prediction was that one day soon we're going to see Radiologists and nuclear medicine taking care of advanced prostate cancer and they may become the experts in the management of prostate cancer and I think we're starting to begin to see a sea change in which nuclear medicine and the experts and the great scientists and the great Physicians are stepping into this field and they're starting to drive the care of advanced prostate cancer patients and\n I think it's a good thing but it's going to take a while for us to sort out all the pros and cons and to step in all the potholes with regards to all all of this stuff once again I'd like to thank all of my collaborators especially we have just a mind-boggling um outstanding group of nuclear medicine people at Mayo they were the ones that figured out the Technologies they're the ones that implemented all the Sops the protocols they anticipated the insurance concerns and they were the ones that really got\n this therapy moving and I applaud them they are brilliant wonderful people and they did a phenomenal job in getting this technology opened up and running at our institution and I've learned a lot from them I also absolutely want to thank all of my overseas collaborators and Friends Dr kesban in Turkey Clemens critakville Dr haberkorn in Germany protocol and haberkorn are probably the inventors of 177 psma Leticia and they should get the Lion's Share of the credit also Dr lenzo in Australia they're developing really hot new\n technologies along this line they they develop they all deserve an incredible amount of Applause and praise from everyone and then I'd like to thank you know all the rest of my collaborators here at Mayo Clinic and I also want to thank my team this is my team I've never shown my team my team is the singular reason that we're able to see 6 000 patients annually within my clinic and I would have to say that the vast majority of our patients are very happy with their care and it isn't because of me it's\n because of my team they're brilliant caring uh Healthcare Providers and I'm very proud of them because they're very smart people and they do a great job um of course my team looks different in 2022 than it did in 2021. so I'll have to update the photo anyway thank you very much [Music]\nSUMMARY \nThe speaker, Eugene Kwon, is discussing Lutetium-177 (also known as Plavixto), a new drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.\nLutetium-177 works by targeting the protein prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on prostate cancer cells, which can be imaged using a PET scan.\nTo be eligible for Lutetium-177 treatment, patients must meet certain criteria including having metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer, metastases that express PSMA, and having been treated with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor and/or chemotherapy.\nThe speaker acknowledges the contributions of international scientists and physicians to the development of this technology.\nThe speaker discusses potential side effects and concerns related to Lutetium-177 treatment, including long-term radiation exposure and the need for follow-up imaging.", "metaData": {"source": "PSMA & Lutetium-177 in 2022 | Eugene Kwon, MD | DIY Combat Manual for Beating Prostate
