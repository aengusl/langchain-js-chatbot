{"pageContent": "For decades, androgen deprivation was the standard of care for metastatic prostate cancer. Chemotherapy, then novel anti-androgen therapies, changed the treatment paradigm. Large phase III randomized clinical trials were conducted over the course of the last decade, first among patients with castration resistant prostate cancer, then among those with hormone-sensitive disease. Today, androgen deprivation therapy alone is no longer the gold standard and should be associated either with chemotherapy in high-volume disease, or novel anti-androgen therapy. As such, each case should be discussed with a specialist to choose the most appropriate treatment.", "metaData": {"source": "Treatment of Oligometastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29869454/"}}
