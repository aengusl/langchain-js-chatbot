{"pageContent": "Several predisposition loci for hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) have been suggested, including HPC1 at 1q24-q25 (OMIM #601518) and HPCX at Xq27-q28 (OMIM #300147). Genetically homogeneous populations, such as that of Finland, and distinct subsets of families may help to minimize the genetic heterogeneity that complicates the genetic dissection of complex traits. Here, the role of the HPC1, and HPCX loci in a series of Finnish prostate cancer families was studied, especially in subgroups of families defined by age, number of affected cases, and the mode of disease transmission. DNA samples were collected from 57 Finnish HPC families with at least two living prostate cancer patients. Linkage analysis was carried out with 39 microsatellite markers for the HPC1 region and 22 markers for the HPCX region. The maximum two-point LOD score for the HPCX was 2.05 (marker DXS1205, at theta = 0.14), whereas HPC1 LOD scores were all negative. In HOMOG3R analyses, significant evidence of heterogeneity was observed. Subgroup analyses performed to explore the nature of this heterogeneity indicated that families with no male-to-male (NMM) transmission and a late age of diagnosis (>65 years) accounted for most of the HPCX-linked cases. The maximum HPCX LOD score in this subgroup was 3.12 (theta = 0.001). Nonparametric sibling pair analyses gave a peak LOD score of 3.04 (P < 0.000093) for the NMM transmission subgroup. No subgroup showed any positivity for HPC1. This study suggests that the HPCX-linked prostate cancer families represent a distinct subgroup characterized by NMM transmission of disease and late age of diagnosis.", "metaData": {"source": "Positive and negative affect and prostate cancer-specific anxiety in Taiwanese patients and their partners\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30473044/"}}
