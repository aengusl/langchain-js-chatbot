{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer units - hubs in the future care of men with prostate cancer Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer in Sweden. The past decade has seen a tremendous development of new methods for diagnosing, staging, treating and rehabilitating men with suspicious or confirmed prostate cancer. This development necessitates a multidisciplinary and multiprofessional approach to the management of men with suspicious or confirmed prostate cancer. A recent survey showed that currently few Swedish men with prostate cancer receive the quality of care that is outlined in the national clinical guidelines. Specialised prostate cancer units are increasingly common in Europe, but as yet there are no such units in Sweden. We believe that the creation of prostate cancer units in Sweden would be an essential step forward, towards an improved future care of men with prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Standardising the Assessment of Patient-reported Outcome Measures in Localised Prostate Cancer.
