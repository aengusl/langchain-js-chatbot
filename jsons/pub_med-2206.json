{"pageContent": "Purpose: Retrospective analyses of cancer registry and institutional data have consistently found better survival after radical prostatectomy versus radiation therapy, which contrasts with findings from a randomized trial. This is likely because of the inability of retrospective studies to fully account for comorbidity differences across treatment groups because of the lack of detailed data in the registries. We use a unique population-based data set with detailed data regarding comorbidities and functional limitations to assess whether this can provide valid comparisons of survival across prostate cancer treatment groups.", "metaData": {"source": "Brachytherapy for prostate cancer: the patient's perspective\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12861739/"}}
