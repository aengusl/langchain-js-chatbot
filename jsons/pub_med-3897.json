{"pageContent": "In the human genome, there is a group of RNAs, called long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) with do not have the function of encoding proteins and whose transcript length is greater than 200 nucleotides. The disorders of lncRNAs are often involved in the occurrence and progression of malignant tumors. A large number of studies have indicated the aberrant expression of lncRNAs in prostate cancer (PCa) can regulate gene expressions at epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels and cause changes in the biological behaviors of PCa cells. Some lncRNAs have been shown to be closely related to the castration resistance of PCa. In recent years, a variety of lncRNAs have been detected in the PCa tissue, prostatic fluid, serum, and urine, and somehow influenced radiotherapy and chemotherapy of tumors. The expressions of some lncRNAs are also associated with disease prognosis. Thus, lncRNAs are expected to become new diagnostic markers and a therapeutic target for PCa. This review focuses on the roles and action modes and mechanisms of some lncRNAs as well as their potential value of clinical application in the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of PCa.", "metaData": {"source": "Prospects for gene therapy in human prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9857369/"}}
