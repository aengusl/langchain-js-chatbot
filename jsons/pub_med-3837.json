{"pageContent": "The incidence of prostate cancer continues to increase in the US. Compared with other common cancers such as those of the breast and lung, the causes of prostate cancer remain poorly understood. Research endeavors continue to identify predictors of risk for prostate cancer, of which familial and genetic factors are among the strongest.
