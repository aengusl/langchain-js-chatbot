{"pageContent": "As earlier detection of prostate cancer increases because of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, appropriate use for watchful waiting warrants re-evaluation. We have drawn together the significant watchful waiting literature and used it to evaluate the use of watchful waiting in the PSA era. We conducted literature searches for studies examining outcomes of watchful waiting and examined new literature emerging about the use of PSA for the follow-up of watchful waiting patients. Watchful waiting has the potential to play an increasingly important role in prostate cancer as less advanced disease is detected and methods are refined for identifying low-risk patients.", "metaData": {"source": "Quality-of-Life Assessment and Reporting in Prostate Cancer: Systematic Review of Phase 3 Trials Testing Anticancer Drugs Published Between 2012 and 2018\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31416754/"}}
