{"pageContent": "Early detection of cancer is a key ingredient for saving many lives. Unfortunately, cancers of the urogenital system are difficult to detect at early stage. The existing noninvasive diagnostics of prostate cancer (PCa) suffer from low accuracy (< 70%) even at advanced stages. In an attempt to improve the accuracy, a small breath study of 63 volunteers representing three groups: (1) of 19 healthy, (2) 28 with PCa, (3) with 8 kidney cancer (KC) and 8 bladder cancer (BC) was performed. Ultrabroadband mid-infrared Fourier absorption spectroscopy revealed eight spectral ranges (SRs) that differentiate the groups. The resulting accuracies of supervised analyses exceeded 95% for four SRs in distinguishing (1) vs (2), three for (1) vs (3) and four SRs for (1) vs (2) + (3). The SRs were then attributed to volatile metabolites. Their origin and involvement in urogenital carcinogenesis are discussed.", "metaData": {"source": "Improved Recovery of Erectile Function in Younger Men after Radical Prostatectomy: Does it Justify Immediate Surgery in Low-risk Patients?\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28851580/"}}
