{"pageContent": "MicroRNAs (MiRNAs) act as key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. This review examines current advances in the study of the role of miRNAs in cancer, including prostate cancer. Issues devoted to the nomenclature, biogenesis, the role of miRNAs as oncogenes and tumor suppressors, and their role in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of prostate cancer are discussed. Assessment ofthe role of miRNAs in the development of prostate cancer will promote early diagnosis and will be important for the development of new approaches to the disease treatment.", "metaData": {"source": "[Prostate cancer units \u2013 hubs in the future care of men with prostate cancer]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28170061/"}}
