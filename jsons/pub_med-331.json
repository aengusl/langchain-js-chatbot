{"pageContent": "Objectives: Bone pain resulting from cancer metastases reduces a patient's quality of life. Magnetic Resonance-guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU) is a promising alternative palliative thermal treatment technique for bone metastases that has been tested in a few clinical studies. Here, we describe a comprehensive pre-clinical study to investigate the effects, and efficacy of MR-HIFU ablation for the palliative treatment of osteoblastic bone metastases in rats.", "metaData": {"source": "A multi-centre prospective development study evaluating focal therapy using high intensity focused ultrasound for localised prostate cancer: The INDEX study\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23774040/"}}
