{"pageContent": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between quality of life, erectile function and group psychotherapy in patients with prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy. Sixty patients were evaluated for erectile function (IIEF-5), quality of life (SF-36SF), urinary incontinence (ICQI-SF and ICQI-OAB). Thirty of them had group psychotherapy two weeks before and 12 weeks after surgery. Patients who underwent group psychotherapy had better scores in IIEF-5, satisfaction with life in general, satisfaction with sexual life and in partner relationship; better results of SF-36SF, excepting two domains: bodily pain and role emotional. There were significant correlations between IIEF-5 and perception of discomfort (p = .030), physical functioning (p = .021), physical component (p = .005) and role emotional (p = .009) in patients undergoing group psychotherapy. In patients who didn't have group psychotherapy there were significant correlations between ICQI-OAB and perception of discomfort (p = .025), social functioning (p = .052) and role emotional (p = .034); between ICQI-SF and perception of discomfort (p = .0001). Group psychotherapy has a positive impact in quality of life and erectile function. There was no difference in the urinary function of the two groups. Further studies are necessary to identify the impact of self-perception and self-knowledge in the postoperative management of radical prostatectomy.", "metaData": {"source": "Core principles of sexual health treatments in cancer for men\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26814146/"}}
