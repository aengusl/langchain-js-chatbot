{"pageContent": "Introduction: While metastatic prostate cancer remains an incurable tumor, remarkable progress has been made with novel drug design strategies for this incurable disease. Several new agents, including hormonal analogues, cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs, radionuclides and innovative targeted therapies, have recently been approved by the FDA for use in advanced and/or metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Furthermore, a growing number of new diagnostic or predictive genetic tests have also been incorporated into the management of this disease. Immunotherapy-based approaches have shown promise and have led to drug approvals. Other experimental approaches such as vascular targeting are in early translational clinical trials.", "metaData": {"source": "Locally advanced prostate cancer: optimal therapy in older patients\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24097331/"}}
