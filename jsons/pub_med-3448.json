{"pageContent": "Despite radical treatment, many men with prostate cancer will develop recurrence of their disease. In an exciting era of new therapies for prostate cancer in general, we focus on how these will specifically benefit those men with recurrent disease. We consider salvage treatments aimed at those with local recurrence confined to the prostate gland, therapies for those presenting with metastatic recurrence and the approach to men presenting with a rising prostate-specific antigen but no demonstrable disease (M0). In general, men with recurrent disease are often under-represented in randomized clinical trials. Consequently, evidence to guide treatment for these men is often lacking and this needs to be addressed in order to improve and better define our approach to this problem in the future.", "metaData": {"source": "Comparative Analysis of Clinical Outcomes and Procedural Costs between the Conventional Two-stage Technique and 4D Brachytherapy for Early Prostate Cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29054374/"}}
