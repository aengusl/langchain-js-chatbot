{"pageContent": "Purpose: After radical prostatectomy, men with adverse pathologic features or a persistent postoperative detectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) are candidates for postoperative radiation therapy (PORT). Previous data have suggested disparities in receipt of adjuvant radiation therapy for adverse pathologic features according to travel distance. Among patients without adverse pathologic features (pT2 disease and negative margins), the main indication for PORT is a persistent postoperative detectable PSA. However, it remains unknown whether the rate of receipt of PORT in this cohort of men with persistently detectable PSA is related to travel distance from the treating facility.", "metaData": {"source": "Changes in prognostic and therapeutic parameters in prostate cancer from an epidemiological view over 20 years\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25633491/"}}
