Its only when these men actively seek alternatives that they discover focal therapy  the middle way in prostate cancer treatment.A trio of researchers considered the role of focal therapy as an alternative to AS and radical treatments in 2018, and concluded that focal therapies have begun to find their middle ground place between definitive therapies and active follow-up.A year later, Dr John Davis from the MD Anderson Cancer Centre in Houston, Texas posed the question:  Is there a middle ground between Active Surveillance and Definitive Treatment? at the annual International Prostate Cancer Update.  Dr Davis recognised the value of establishing a middle ground but urged caution in defining endpoints of that middle, citing the need for improvement in both MRI and ablation techniques.More recently Dr Steven Scionti, of the Scionti Prostate Centre in Florida, asked If there were a clinically and economically balanced approach to detecting and treating prostate cancer, what would it look like? He examined criteria that would illuminate a logical middle-ground approach to diagnosing and treating prostate cancer, which are as follows:Applying these criteria, Dr Scionti determined HIFU focal therapy to be a Golden Mean, standing up well as a logical and balanced response to the needs of todays patients. He concludesHIFU is a logical treatment consideration for the following types of patients. Those who are diagnosed with low-to-moderate risk localized prostate cancer may seek a Middle Way or Golden Mean between radical whole-gland treatments and observation as a way to buy time before treatment. Those who are drawn to Active Surveillance, including lifestyle changes in diet, exercise, etc. may discuss with their doctors the merits of a focal HIFU treatment as a way to destroy the tumor while preserving their healthy prostate tissue, urinary and sexual function. Those whose cancer has come back after radiotherapy (external beam or seed implants) may logically consider a HIFU ablation as a potentially curative alternative to hormone therapy.TFTC Consultant Urologist Tim Dudderidge also regards focal therapy as a middle way for many of his patients.So we now have a paradox where patients who previously we werent treating because the outcomes didnt seem so good are exactly the patients we need to treat radically, and the patients who get really good outcomes actually maybe they dont need any treatment at all ...and somewhere in the middle is this group of patients where were increasingly uncertain about the benefits of more radical treatments, but were also a bit uneasy about doing nothing and just monitoring. These patients are the ones where theres an opportunity to use something less invasive that still gets the advantages of treatment.The scope and breadth of the middle way will continue to evolve and redefine as diagnostics and focal treatments improve, and most importantly as both patients and clinicians become more conversant about individual perspectives on risk and quality of life. Its not as simple or black and white as total cure with side effects versus partial or temporary cure with no  side effects.But one thing is for sure: patients knowledge about their treatment options is growing, and their confidence in challenging clinicians and seeking alternative opinions about their care is growing too. This, combined with continual development in approaches to focal therapy and evidence on their efficacy, will both widen and strengthen the Middle Way for prostate cancer treatment.Do you have questions about focal therapy and where it sits between Active Surveillance and other definitive treatments such as radical prostatectomy?
