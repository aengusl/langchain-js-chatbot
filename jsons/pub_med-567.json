{"pageContent": "With the advent of PSA dosing, an increasing number of prostate cancers are being detected at a local stage. Since 1989, our group has been developing a research project with the aim of establishing treatment of localised prostate cancer by means of HIFU. The treatment is performed transrectally, using ultrasound imaging guidance only. The quality of HIFU treatment depends on four factors: the intensity of the transmitted pulse, the exposure time, the signal frequency, and the time between two firing bursts. The lesions are created by a thermal effect. Their slightly conical form is due to the absorption of ultrasound by tissue, enhanced by cavitation bubbles. Results obtained since 1993 demonstrate that transrectally administered HIFU treatment achieves local control of localised prostate cancer in 80% of cases, with 70% complete success and 30% partial response. The use of an annular array probe with variable focus and frequency should significantly improve results in the future. Finally, real time visual display of the damaged tissue via differential imaging of the attenuation coefficient should give the surgeon an instant appreciation of the result of the sequence. It would thus be possible to repeat treatment of insufficiently covered zones in the same session.", "metaData": {"source": "[Transrectal ultrasound in prostate cancer patients: what can we really see?]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24253520/"}}
