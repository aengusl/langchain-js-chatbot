{"pageContent": "Androgen ablation and chemotherapy provide effective palliation for most patients with advanced prostate cancer, but eventually progressing androgen-independent prostate cancer threatens the lives of patients usually within a few years, mandating improvement in therapy. Proteasome inhibition has been proposed as a therapy target for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies. The proteasome is a ubiquitous enzyme complex that is a hub for the regulation of many intracellular regulatory pathways; because of its essential function, this enzyme has become a new target for cancer treatment. Studies with bortezomib (VELCADE, formerly known as PS-341) and other proteasome inhibitors indicate that cancer cells are especially dependent on the proteasome for survival, and several mechanisms used by prostate cancer cells require proteasome function. Bortezomib has been studied extensively in vitro and in vivo, and anticancer activity has been seen in cell and animal models for several solid tumor types, including prostate cancer. A Phase I trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose of once-weekly bortezomib has been completed. This trial included a large fraction of patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer. The maximum tolerated dose was reached at 1.6 mg/m(2). A correlation was seen among bortezomib dose, proteasome inhibition, and positive modulation of serum prostate-specific antigen. There was also evidence of down-regulation of serum interleukin 6, a downstream nuclear factor kappaB effector. This Phase I trial and preclinical studies support additional testing of bortezomib in combination with radiation or chemotherapy for androgen-independent prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "A Phase I Study of Capivasertib in Combination With Abiraterone Acetate in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36572571/"}}
