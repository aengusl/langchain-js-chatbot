{"pageContent": "Clinical nomograms based on Gleason grade, tumor stage, and serum PSA are still the best predictors of prostate cancer (PC) outcome. The biotechnological advancements achieved in the last decade represent a remarkable source for new prognostic and predictive tissue and serum molecular biomarkers. In this review, we will summarize conventional PC prognostic biomarkers and focus on novel identified biomarkers for PC early diagnosis and progression that might be used in the future. Although they are not ready for widespread, routine use, there are reasons to believe that future models will combine these markers with traditional pretreatment and treatment-related variables and will improve our ability to predict outcome and select the optimal treatment.", "metaData": {"source": "Racial differences in mortality among Medicare recipients after treatment for localized prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14625261/"}}
