{"pageContent": "Mortality from prostate cancer is two to three times greater among African-American men between the ages of 50 and 70 than among American Caucasian men of similar ages. Also, African-Americans tend to present with more advanced tumors than their American Caucasian counterparts. This article explores differences between the two races that may account for the disproportionately high mortality among African-Americans and their more advanced disease stage at presentation. These include epidemiologic and histologic features of prostate cancer; clinical, biologic, and environmental factors; and barriers to health care. Various important issues that warrant further investigation are also highlighted.", "metaData": {"source": "Noncanonical Wnt as a prognostic marker in prostate cancer: \"you can't always get what you Wnt\"\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31814454/"}}
