{"pageContent": "Background: High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a promising treatment method for many common cancers, including prostate cancer. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) guidance of HIFU permits targeting and monitoring of therapy. A prototype MRI-compatible positioning device that navigates a HIFU transducer was designed, fabricated and tested.", "metaData": {"source": "High-intensity-focused ultrasound in the treatment of primary prostate cancer: the first UK series\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19513068/"}}
