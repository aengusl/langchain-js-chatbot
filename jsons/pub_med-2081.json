{"pageContent": "Background: pp32 is a differentiation-regulated nuclear phosphoprotein that is highly expressed in many cancers, but is restricted to self-renewing and long-lived normal cell populations. During murine embryogenesis, pp32 is expressed in primitive cell populations, diminishing as tissues terminally differentiate. Functionally, pp32 confers resistance to programmed cell death and, paradoxically, inhibits transformation mediated in vitro by a broad range of oncogenes, suggesting that pp32 is a multifunctional molecule with potentially complex activities in cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Symptoms and Impacts in Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Qualitative Study Findings\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28285412/"}}
