Truncated transcript. Last weeks Inside Health special on prostate cancer prompted many of you to get in touch and we put some of your comments to one of the main contributors to the programme, Mark Emberton, Professor of Interventional Oncology at University College London.EmbertonIve seen a lot of patients since the programme and they loved it.  I thought it would be a little bit too complex but actually no they liked the detail that you went into.PorterWell you say that but it seemed to raise as many questions as it answered but of course thats the nature of prostate cancer and the uncertainty that surrounds so much of its diagnosis and treatment.  There was a lot of interest in conventional ultrasound guide biopsy missing cancers and one listener wondered about the TURP operation.  He had to bore out his enlarged benign prostate.  He said  given the scrapings were sent away for analysis would they be a reliable guide to whether his prostate was cancerous or not  because thats a form of biopsy?EmbertonSo the TURP typically we do for enlarged prostates where we dont think is cancer is present.  And the procedure basically removes the apple core of the apple and makes men pee more easily.  Now we look at that tissue very carefully but thats not typically where cancers originate from.  And so whilst it tells us that theres no cancer within that tissue it doesnt provide the reassurance that this man is after.  But a low PSA after a TURP would be very reassuring.  If theres any doubt at all wed tend to let the prostate settle down for a few months and then do an MRI.PorterWe also mentioned, of course, the results of the Protec study which found no difference in outcomes in men who opted for active surveillance compared to surgery and compared to radiotherapy.  But one listener was wondering about brachytherapy, this is a form of radiotherapy that he had, is that lumped in with radiotherapy, is it equivalent to the rest?EmbertonThere are many ways of delivering radiotherapy.  The Protec study could only do one, which was external beam radiation therapy, listeners will have heard of proton beam therapy, which got into the news last year, brachytherapy is another way of getting the radiation into the prostate.  Theyre all considered to be equivalent in terms of their ability to control the disease.PorterWe also spoke a lot about clinically significant disease and that MRIs better at detecting it than ultrasound guided biopsy.  One listener asked us to clarify what we actually meant by clinically significant.EmbertonYoure smiling, as I am, because this is a difficult one.  This is disease we know is significant when we see it.  So typically a bulky cancer that we can feel or indeed see on MRI that is high grade.  In other words more like the tiger versus the pussy cat.  So theres a disease out there that we could all identify as being important in that if left untreated it is very likely that that mans quality or quantity of life will be diminished.PorterSo by clinical significant what youre saying is this is a potential threat to the wellbeing of the man and we need to do something about it?EmbertonExactly right.  And this is disease that is typically of increased volume, so in other words big, and high grade.PorterOne of the key messages to come out of last weeks programme was that advances in MRI mean we are now much better at determining where cancer is within the prostate, raising the possibility of a new generation of targeted treatments. So, instead of irradiating or removing the whole gland, you just treat the part with the cancer  hopefully reducing the risk of side effects like incontinence and erection difficulties.Killing tumours with high intensity focussed ultrasound (HIFU) is one such technique that is currently being trialled at Southampton General Hospital. I went to see consultant urological surgeon Tim Dudderidge to learn more.DudderidgeThe prostate gland, Im holding a small model here which is probably about 50 cubic centimetres in size and this is a 3D rendered model of an MRI scan of someones prostate.  And you can see that the tumour in this particular case may be between one and two cubic centimetres and this is a fairly small tumour that one might consider suitable for HIFU treatment.PorterSo its like a small pea in the middle of a plum.DudderidgeThats right.  So when I see people with these kind of findings, as I was doing this morning, you go through the different options and this is a means of treatment that involves heating up the prostate and thats done using this probe here, which produces ultrasound which is focused.  And that heat energy is concentrated in a small area about the size of a grain of rice and that focal point will get to about 80 or 90 degrees Centigrade.  Now obviously the prostate is bigger than a grain of rice and so when youre planning this treatment you have ultrasound images which you capture using the same device and you can plan on the screen where you want to treat.  And so originally we were treating the whole of the prostate but we realised that actually this is a much better technology for just partially treating the prostate.  And so you would plan out the areas based upon your understanding of where the cancer is, based upon the imaging, and that will enable you to ablate the tumour and the surrounding area and avoid important structures like the urethra or sphincter, the bladder and the neurovascular bundles.SprangerMy names Howard Spranger, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer December 2014.  For a couple of years before Id sort of had trouble going to the loo sometimes in the night.PorterGetting up for a pee.SprangerYeah, yeah and I did recall my father once having to have an ambulance to take him away because he had a similar problem.  And I just thought it was a family trait.  And  but I got it checked out eventually and it was kind of inconclusive.  I suppose at the back of my mind there was always the possibility that it might be a cancer in the prostate.  But you dont want to think that way and nothing led to it really at that time.DudderidgeHowards PSA was rising and at that point we felt it was necessary to get an MRI scan.  In his case the MRI scan showed an area on one side of the prostate which appeared to be abnormal.  And at that time it was my practice to do mapping biopsies of these cases.  And those biopsies really identified that the disease was only on one side, matching up with the imaging findings, and then that led us into a conversation about his options really between focal therapy or between having surgery or radiotherapy.SprangerThe surgery to remove the whole gland  it felt to me like overtreatment but that was just because all I knew was that the cancer was fairly localised.  And it was a big thing to go into as well, the potential side effects  incontinence and impotence really was what it boiled down to, neither of which prospects were particularly appealing.  And Id already been briefed on HIFU, Id been told about it.  The fact that it was not surgical just appealed to me, I mean Ive a fairly technical background and it was something I thought yeah this is a good novel new way of doing something and the least worse option, if you like.DudderidgeNow as a general rule when were treating the prostate what were trying to do is trying to obtain lower side effects than you get with surgery, so this is the main advantage  you want to not have any incontinence, not have any erectile dysfunction.  And so whilst were treating half the gland you might treat one of the nerve bundles but we know that by completing untreating the other side most people will have normal erections afterwards.  And so what we find is about quarter of people may need to use a Viagra or one of these drugs afterwards but only one in 20 probably dont have erections despite that. PorterSo how do you actually operate  presumably the patients lying on their back, this probe goes into the rectum, up their bottom effectively...DudderidgeThats right.PorterAnd then that gives you the pictures that youre looking at.DudderidgeSo we start off by bringing the patient into the operating theatre under an anaesthetic.  We put the legs up so we can access the perineum and the probe goes into the back passage, its got lots of lubricating jelly and that makes a good contact for the sound energy to travel through.  We then take some images of the prostate and then we mark it out in three different areas typically  the front, the middle and the back  and these areas overlap so you dont get any gaps in the treatment.PorterBut the idea effectively is to leave as much healthy prostate tissue as possible and the surrounding structures, like the nerves, untreated?DudderidgeThats correct.  And so the degree to which you do that is something thats of interest to us because we might be able to bring it closer and closer to the lesion, the more and more confident we are that we know where the lesion is.PorterAnd how long does the procedure take?DudderidgeYoure talking about two hours in theatre.  So we normally do four cases in a day.PorterOf course the big difference between this procedure and removing the gland completely is the cancerous tissue is potentially still inside the patient, you hoped to have killed it but do you know for sure?DudderidgeSo Im someone who does surgery and I do focal therapy and so Im often torn with this situation where somebody who on paper is somebody who could be a candidate for a trial.  We have very rigid trial inclusion criteria.  So I no longer have to worry about it myself, I have some rules and I follow the rules.  And yet despite that therell be a bit of me anxious about whether they should be having a complete removal of the prostate.  And so you do live with this uncertainty.  And the reason Im uncertain is because we dont know and were running a trial and were taking these patients where we dont know which is best for them and were offering them the chance of randomisation.  And I think this is the best way to answer this question and I really encourage all the patients to consider this.  But lets say weve treated someone with HIFU and were monitoring them, they will require long term follow up, which may involve repeated imaging and biopsy and they may require repeated treatment if theyre unfortunate enough to have a recurrence.  We know from the data about one in five will need a retreatment and about one in 10 will need their prostate removing and patients have been told that beforehand, theyve signed up to that but for the majority of patients they will have one treatment episode which gets rid of their disease, leaves them with few side effects.  A substantial number of patients will avoid major surgery who will have otherwise had it or radical radiotherapy and I think for those men who do avoid it successfully, which is the vast majority, this is a really important thing for them.PorterTim Dudderidge talking to me in Southampton. Mark Emberton, youre also working on a new localised approach to treating tumours in the prostate and one thats been in the headlines recently.EmbertonYeah so youre describing focal treatment.  Its interesting prostates probably the last organ that exists where we typically treat at the whole gland level.  When I was training as a urologist I was taught to remove the whole kidney if somebody had renal cancer, today we go to huge efforts to try and preserve as much kidney as possible.  And obviously mammography has changed the way we manage breast cancer, that happened 40, 50 years ago.  MRI is now identifying disease, we can see very, very tiny cancers that measure 0.2 ccs, thats about eight millimetres across and its not beyond the wit of man then to direct energy at those cancers plus a little margin around them and by doing so treat the cancer and try and preserve function.PorterNow Southampton are using HIFU as weve just heard, what are you using?EmbertonWere using a range of treatments at present.  The interest a couple of weeks ago related to vascular targeted phototherapy.  This is a slightly complicated treatment in that we give a drug that sensitises the body to light and then we introduce light fibres into the prostate and that interaction between the light and the photosensitiser releases what we call free radicals which damage the cancer cells and actually stop the blood supply to those cells.PorterAnd this combination of photosensitising and laser light has been used elsewhere.EmbertonIt has been used actually, particularly successfully in difficult to treat areas, such as head and neck cancers where there are lots of key vital structures where typically surgery and radiotherapy result in damage  loss of voice, loss of being able to swallow.  Photodynamic therapy or VTP is fascinating and offers a great opportunity to patients because it represents a new class of therapy, in other words a new way of treating prostate cancer.  This is the first mature trial of photodynamic therapy that shows benefit over and above a control, which in this case was active surveillance.PorterNow HIFUs work in progress, your own work presumably is still very much work in progress, how long do you think it will be before well know for sure whether these treatments are safe to use in men?EmbertonWe know quite a lot about these treatments because HIFU, for instance, has been around for about 10 years now and theres quite a lot in the published literature.  So we know about the safety, we know about the tolerability, so men having tissue preservation are very likely to be the same in functional terms  and by that I mean erections and incontinence  than they were before treatment.  We also know what we call the early oncological outcomes, so in other words the cancer results at one and two years.  What we dont yet know is what the outcome is going to be in 10 years because all new treatments we just have to wait for that long term data.PorterBut you see localised treatment as the way forward?EmbertonVery much so.  I think our ability to risk stratify, so in other words to be very, very precise about the true cancer that that man has, puts us in a position now to offer a range of treatments that include surveillance, that include very radical surgery and radiotherapy for the very aggressive disease and then in the middle theres an opportunity for men to have their cancer treated but really diminish the side effects that have been typically associated with standard treatments.PorterProfessor Mark Emberton.
