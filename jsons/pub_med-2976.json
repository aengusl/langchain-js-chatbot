{"pageContent": "The necessity of pelvic lymph node dissection has been questioned in recent years as a result of improved pre-treatment staging based on clinical and pathologic factors. Accurate evaluation of nodal status allows rational selection of therapy and improved outcomes. Nevertheless, lymph node dissection may play a role even in patients with low stage disease (clinical T1c) despite an overall low risk for metastases. Herein we discuss recent advances in the evaluation of lymph nodes in stage T1c prostate cancer with respect to accurate prediction, radiologic imaging, molecular characterization, and operative considerations.", "metaData": {"source": "Localized prostate cancer: radiation or surgery?\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12735507/"}}
