{"pageContent": "Not long ago, survival rates were the primary outcome measures of surgical management of prostate cancer. Currently, more attention is paid to the quality of life, because even minor changes in the quality of life can lead to serious alterations in the psycho-emotional status and significantly reduce patients' self-esteem. Most experts believe that the quality of life of patients treated for prostate cancer, is mostly affected by urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, urethral stricture, and bowel dysfunction. Thanks to advances in the treatment of prostate cancer, the incidence of complications was reduced to a minimum. To some extent, this was due to the use of novel minimally invasive treatment for prostate cancer, such as cryoablation, interstitial brachytherapy and HIFU-therapy. The quality of life in 65 patients undergoing cryoablation of the prostate was evaluated using EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Analyzing the findings of the survey enabled us to estimate the patients' quality of life, as well as to identify the various components of the postoperative health problems.", "metaData": {"source": "Status of the Microcirculatory Network as a Factor of Prognosis and Evaluation of Therapeutic Efficiency in Prostate Cancer Treated by High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound in Combination with Androgen Deprivation\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30225720/"}}
