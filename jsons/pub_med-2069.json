{"pageContent": "Purpose: Growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) appear at high levels in prostate cancer (PC). Abiraterone is an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor which is currently in use as a standard treatment in clinics to impair tumor growth. Development of resistance to anticancer therapies is unfortunately a very common feature of cancer cells that threatens the patient lives. This study aimed to investigate whether FGF-2 and HGF act as a possible resistant mechanism to the abiraterone activity on the androgen synthesis pathway in PC.", "metaData": {"source": "Identifying Risk Profiles of Malignant Prostate Cancer Surgical Delay Using a Person-Centered Approach to Understand Prostate Cancer Disparities: The Constellation of Health Determinants Using Latent Class Analysis on Cancer Registry Data\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33372564/"}}
