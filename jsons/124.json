{"pageContent": "In Focal Therapy, the aim is to get rid of the cancer that is causing concern whilst ensuring that the patient does not become incontinent and has a much lower chance of losing erectile function.Mr Tim Dudderidge, Urological Consultant at The Focal Therapy ClinicAn estimated 1 in 8 white men in the UK will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime. This risk increase to 1 in 4 black men of African Caribbean origins.Men with organ confined, localised prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 7 or less can be considered for Focal Therapy. At The Focal Therapy Clinic, we offer precise, non-invasive and successful treatments for localised prostate cancer with minimal side effects. These treatments are High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) and Irreversible Electroporation (NanoKnife IRE).  \n\n\n\nHIFU (High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound) treatment is the most popular and well-evidenced type of focal therapy treatment for prostate cancer with over 20 years of clinical use, over 50,000 patients treated and multiple successful clinical trials.Focal HIFU treatment is effective in treating medium to large-volume prostate cancers in the lower part of the prostate gland where over 75% of prostate cancer occurs. More recently Focal  NanoKnife treatment is being used to treat the 25% of prostate cancer tumours which occur in the front of the prostate gland which were often not possible to treat with HIFU treatment. HIFU is an ultrasound wave-based treatment for prostate cancer that uses a pair of high-intensity ultrasound beams to heat targeted areas of the prostate, destroying cancer cells and preserving sensitive prostate tissue and structures which do not have cancer cells.  the HIFU procedure is carried out under general anaesthetic and sophisticated 3D MRI Fusion software is used to guide the treatment of the targeted prostate cancer cells.Extensive clinical trials have shown that HIFU provides effective cancer control whilst preserving erectile function and urinary continence.A UK based clinical trial of 625 men who had the HIFU procedure was reported in 2018 and 2021 and its results were very encouraging. 100% of men had no urinary problems within 2 weeks of treatment and 95% of men had a normal erectile function at 6 weeks after treatment. At 8 years after treatment, cancer control amongst the men treated on the trials was equivalent to a group of similar men who had undergone Robotic Prostatectomy.Using precision diagnostics, we are able to pinpoint and treat the specific area of cancer. Traditional prostate cancer treatment is like using a sledgehammer to kill a flea.Mr Alan Doherty, Urological Consultant at The Focal Therapy ClinicUsing precision diagnostics, we are able to pinpoint and treat the specific area of cancer. Traditional prostate cancer treatment is like using a sledgehammer to kill a flea.Alan Doherty, Urological Consultant at The Focal Therapy ClinicSteves story (04:15)The main benefit of Focal HIFU prostate cancer treatment for localised prostate cancer is the clinical precision with which it can be performed. Targeting only the prostate cancer cells,  the HIFU treatment enables the other tissues and structures of the prostate and surrounding area to remain completely untouched. This ensures that any damage to healthy tissue is avoided  something that typically increases the risk of the debilitating side effects associated with traditional prostate cancer therapies, such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction.Unsurprisingly, these side effects can significantly affect your quality of life, even after the cancer has gone. Other key benefits of HIFU therapy for prostate cancer include:The prospect of cancer treatment can be daunting, but it can help to ease your worries if you know what to expect. Heres everything you need to know about before, during and after HIFU prostate cancer treatment. Before you can have Focal HIFU prostate cancer treatment, youll first need to have your suitability for the procedure assessed to ensure that it is the right treatment for you. This will involve a consultation with your consultant urologist / surgeon, where youll discuss your medical history and cancer diagnosis, and talk about what you hope to gain from your treatment and any worries that you have. The critical point that your consultant will focus upon is to ensure that the MRI scan and histopathology biopsy results produce a detailed image of the area of the prostate that has prostate cancer cells and confirms that the rest of the prostate does not have clinically significant prostate cancer. We may need to carry out some tests such as MRI scan and a biopsy to find out more about the tumour in your prostate. Your consultant will explain why each test is necessary and what to expect at each step of the process. Physical preparation for your treatment has been shown to be a contributing factor in its success and your recovery. Your surgeon will explain to you the importance of eating well before and after your surgery. They will also talk to you about the various steps youll need to take to prepare for the Focal HIFU procedure, such as if there are any medications you should stop taking before treatment and when you should stop eating and drinking before your general anaesthetic. Your surgeon and specialist nurse will be able to answer any questions you have so that you understand all that the treatment involves. Theyll tell you how long the surgery will take, what you can expect from your recovery and when you can get back to your usual daily activities such as exercising or going to work.HIFU is a non-invasive treatment for prostate cancer. This means that there are no incisions made into the skin and no wounds to care for afterwards. On the morning of your treatment, you may be given an enema to empty your bowels. This will make it easier for your surgeon to see the images of your prostate clearly, ensuring the accuracy of your treatment. The HIFU treatment is performed under general anaesthetic, which will put you into a deep sleep before it takes place. Once you are anaesthetised, a lubricated probe will be inserted into your rectum. This probe will emit a high frequency, ultrasound energy to heat and destroy the cancer cells in the prostate. It treats just a very small area at a time, and your surgeon will move the beam around to ensure all the cancer cells are targeted. The treatment is guided by 3D MRI imaging software to ensure accuracy. The probe is surrounded by a cooling balloon to protect the rectum.  The Focal HIFU procedure for prostate cancer normally takes between one and two hours.Every patient is unique and recovery from your HIFU procedure will depend on multiple factors, including your age and fitness level. You should expect it to take up to 48 hours for the effects of the general anaesthetic to wear off, so you should not drive until this time has passed, although you will still be able to return home the same day. Youll be fitted with a catheter as part of your surgery, and you will need to wear this for up to seven days. Your care team will show you how to manage this at home. Patients can expect to be able to pass urine easily and with good bladder control as soon as the catheter is removed. Your surgeon will talk to you about the importance of taking enough time to rest and recover following your surgery. You will be advised to avoid heavy lifting or strenuous exercise for at least a week, and sexual intercourse until your catheter is removed. Its important to follow all aftercare and follow-up appointment instructions provided to you by your surgical team.
