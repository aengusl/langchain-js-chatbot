{"pageContent": "Clinical outcomes in prostate cancer are heterogeneous, and given the high prevalence of the disease, there is a pressing need to identify clinically useful markers of prognosis. Many clinical, pathological, molecular, and genetic factors have been investigated in this capacity, although relatively few are routinely used. With a growing understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of prostate cancer, there is the potential that the next generation of makers will prove sufficiently robust to guide the optimal management of men with prostate cancer. Here, we review the various clinical and molecular prognostic determinants in prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Development of Novel PSMA Ligands for Imaging and Therapy with Copper Isotopes\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31541034/"}}
