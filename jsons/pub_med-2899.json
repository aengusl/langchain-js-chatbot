{"pageContent": "In view of the increasing incidence and mortality rate of prostate cancer in Japan, the management of elderly patients with prostate cancer is an important issue now. We therefore analyzed the clinicopathological features and long-term outcomes of 182 patients with prostate cancer, aged 75 or older, in order to establish the treatment strategy for this age group of patients. There were more patients with advanced disease (stage C-D) than those with localized disease (stage A2-B), and the patients with moderate to poorly differentiated tumors were more numerous than those with well-differentiated tumors. The overall survival curve of the patients with localized prostate cancer was in line with the age-matched expected survival curve, while that with advanced prostate cancer was far below the expected survival curve. These results demonstrated that advanced prostate cancer in elderly patients is as harmful as in younger patients, indicating the necessity for early detection and treatment of prostate cancer among the younger generation. On the other hand, localized prostate cancer in elderly patients should be treated less invasively to maintain their quality of life.", "metaData": {"source": "MR-Guided High-Intensity Directional Ultrasound Ablation of Prostate Cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33403460/"}}
