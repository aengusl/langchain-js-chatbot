{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is the most common cancer of men over 50 years old. Localized prostatic cancer treatment may be responsible of a decline of patient's quality of life. The main actors of treatment are now focused on minimizing functional consequences of treatments. The radiation oncologist has a central role in patient monitoring. The follow-up is codified by official recommendations of learned societies to enhance the post-cancer period. The main objective of this article is to review the recommendations for clinical and biological follow-up. An inventory of the functional consequences of the various treatments will be detailed, and particularly those caused by androgen deprivation therapy, with a review of precautions before implementation, adverse effects and their management, as well as monitoring recommendations. The analysis of quality of life after curative treatment and suggestions to improve monitoring will also be discussed.", "metaData": {"source": "Impacts of leuprolide acetate on quality of life in patients with prostate cancer: a prospective multicenter study\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20707648/"}}
