{"pageContent": "Purpose of review: The index lesion theory has created a strong interest in partial gland ablation for men with prostate cancer. By only treating the focus of clinically significant disease and avoidance of surrounding periprostatic tissue, one may provide adequate oncologic control with minimal side effects.
