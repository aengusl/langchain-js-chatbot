{"pageContent": "We reviewed the current evidence for three novel prostate tumor markers (PCA3, TMPRSS2:ERG and proPSA) that have been recently reported predominantly in Western countries. We focus our attention on Asian men in both clinical and basic research studies. There have been no reports on the clinical usefulness of these three markers for Asians living in Western countries. In Asian countries, evidence for the clinical usefulness of PCA3 and proPSA-related indices including Prostate Health Index is being accumulated, mainly in Japan. The process for how a novel marker is approved in the clinical setting is also discussed.", "metaData": {"source": "Quality-of-life questionnaire results 2 and 3 years after radiotherapy for prostate cancer in a randomized dose-escalation study\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14550448/"}}
