{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is diagnosed mostly in men over the age of 50 years, and has favorable 5-year survival rates due to early cancer detection and availability of curative surgical management. However, progression to metastasis and emergence of therapeutic resistance are responsible for the majority of prostate cancer mortalities. Recent advancement in sequencing technologies and computational capabilities have improved the ability to organize and analyze large data, thus enabling the identification of novel biomarkers for survival, metastatic progression and patient prognosis. Large-scale sequencing studies have also uncovered genetic and epigenetic signatures associated with prostate cancer molecular subtypes, supporting the development of personalized targeted-therapies. However, the current state of mainstream prostate cancer management does not take full advantage of the personalized diagnostic and treatment modalities available. This review focuses on interrogating biomarkers of prostate cancer progression, including gene signatures that correspond to the acquisition of tumor lethality and those of predictive and prognostic value in progression to advanced disease, and suggest how we can use our knowledge of biomarkers and molecular subtypes to improve patient treatment and survival outcomes.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer.
