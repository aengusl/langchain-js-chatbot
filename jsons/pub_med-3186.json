{"pageContent": "Estimating prognosis with patients with metastatic disease is important for patient counseling, guiding treatment selection, and assessing treatment outcomes. For patients with noncastrate metastatic disease, androgen ablation is considered first-line therapy, with upward of 80% of patients showing clinical benefit.
