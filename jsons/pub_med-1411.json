{"pageContent": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) following transperineal prostate biopsy (TPB) was prospectively evaluated. From January 2011 to January 2014, 1050 patients were submitted to TPB: 18 core (extended TPB) in 610 cases, 28 core (saturation TPB) in 360 cases and 32 core (saturation plus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) targeted TPB) in 210 cases. The indications for biopsy were increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or PSA>10 ng ml(-1). All patients were prospectively evaluated with the 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) at time zero and at 1, 3 and 6 months from TPB. Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 385/1050 (36.6%) patients; 560 men (350 vs 110 vs 100) having benign histology and normal sexual activity also completed the study. Overall, IEEF-5 score at time zero and at 1, 3 and 6 months did not significantly worsen (P>0.05); in detail, at 1 month from biopsy 15 extended TPB (4.2%) vs 7 saturation TPB (6.4%) vs 7 saturation plus MRI targeted TPB (7%) men referred mild ED that disappeared after 3 months. Irrespective of method (18 vs 28 vs 32 core) TPB did not significantly worsen erectile function at 3-6 months from the procedure.", "metaData": {"source": "Ethnicity and the prostate cancer experience: a qualitative metasynthesis\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27416079/"}}
