{"pageContent": "When you\u2019re close to someone with prostate cancer, the diagnosis can affect you just as much as them. As well as affecting how you feel, it may also change your relationship with them as your plans and priorities change.\nThis page is for anyone who is close to someone with prostate cancer, whether you're a partner, family member or friend. It looks at ways you can support someone with prostate cancer, where to get more information and how you can look after yourself.\nYou can find out more about prostate cancer and treatments on our other pages. You can also call our Specialist Nurses or chat to them online.\nIf you\u2019re close to someone with prostate cancer you\u2019re likely to want to give them support and be there for them. Research suggests that family and friends who offer emotional and practical support may help men deal better with the daily challenges of having prostate cancer.\nDoing something to help might also ease your own feelings of distress and help you feel more in control. But be aware of your limits and try to remember that you don\u2019t have to do everything on your own. Think about whether your friends or family could help out with some things. Social services and charities can also be good places to get support.\nDealing with a diagnosis of cancer, having treatment and managing side effects can be challenging. We know from research that men with prostate cancer and their partners have a higher risk of depression and anxiety. Read more about the feelings men might go through when they have prostate cancer. \nIf you notice that your loved one is feeling very down, worried or is finding it hard to cope, encourage him to speak to his doctor or nurse. There are treatments and support available. They can also speak to our Specialist Nurses or ring the Samaritans if they need to speak to someone urgently. \nMany partners, family and friends find it helps to learn more about prostate cancer. Some people like to read lots about prostate cancer, while others prefer not to know as much.\nLearning about prostate cancer can help you and your loved one feel more informed and confident about making decisions. It may also help you both feel more prepared for what will happen during and after treatment.\nIf you choose to get information, it\u2019s important to get it from places and people that you trust. Health professionals may give you information, or you can find information online or in print, like booklets and fact sheets. You can download or order any of our publications for free.\nGetting information about prostate cancer can help you and your loved one in many ways. \nMaking a decision\nOften men with prostate cancer will have a choice about what treatment to have. This is because there isn\u2019t always an overall best treatment, and each treatment has its own advantages and disadvantages. Some men may also have a choice about whether or not to have treatment straight away, which can be a difficult\ndecision to make. Finding out more about treatments and side effects can help.\nSome men find having support from their partner, family or friends helps when making this decision. For example, you could talk through the advantages and disadvantages of each treatment together and think about what\u2019s right for him.\nKnowing what to expect\nKnowing more about prostate cancer and treatment can help you prepare for what will happen and the possible side effects of treatment. Treatments for prostate cancer can all cause side effects, such as:\n\u2022 difficulty getting or keeping erections (erectile dysfunction)\n\u2022 urinary problems (incontinence)\n\u2022 bowel problems\n\u2022 extreme tiredness (fatigue).\nA common treatment called hormone therapy can also cause other side effects such as hot flushes, loss of sex drive, breast swelling, weight gain, muscle loss, forgetfulness and mood changes, such as feeling more irritable or emotional. Read more about how hormone therapy affects men.\nSide effects can affect a man\u2019s everyday life and the lives of those close to him. Dealing with these feelings, as well as with the cancer itself, can make men feel worried and sometimes depressed. But there are ways to manage side effects. And getting information about prostate cancer can often help you both feel more reassured about side effects and what to expect in the future. \nTalking to health professionals\nSome people find it helps to have someone with them at their appointments. It\u2019s hard to take everything in, ask questions and make notes all at the same time. Having someone else there to remember and ask questions can be useful.\nHealth professionals involved in your loved one\u2019s care may not be able to discuss his diagnosis, treatment or care with you, unless he gives them permission. If he is happy for you to know about these things, he needs to let his doctor or nurse know. He can request this for anyone \u2013 whether that\u2019s a partner, family member or friend.\nSome people don\u2019t feel confident talking to health professionals. But it\u2019s always worth asking if you\u2019re not sure about something, or if you have a question or concern. Sometimes health professionals will ask if you have any questions. But if they don\u2019t, it could be because they assume you understand what has been said, or that you would ask if you had any questions.\nAs a partner or relative, you also have the right to information and support for yourself. If you don\u2019t feel able to talk to the doctors or nurses treating your loved one, make an appointment with your GP. Or you can call our Specialist Nurses, who are here for you too.\nMany men with prostate cancer value being able to talk to those close to them about how they are feeling. It can help get things out in the open. There is no right or wrong thing to say \u2013 sometimes you might just need to listen. Macmillan Cancer Support has information about how to talk to someone with cancer.\nYou and your loved one might not always want to or feel able to talk. Some people need some support to open up and express how they are feeling. Talking to someone else, such as a friend, health professional or counsellor might be helpful, either together or separately.\nAnd remember, you will be dealing with your own feelings too and may also need time to talk about them.\nWhat if he doesn't want to talk?\nSome men prefer to cope on their own and don\u2019t want to talk about things, or want any outside help.\nYou might find this frustrating or upsetting. But try to remember that they might not see things the same way as you. Even if you think that they need some practical help or should be talking about their emotions, they might feel that they\u2019re coping fine.\n\nTry to help them think about what they want, rather than telling them what they should do. You can do this by asking questions or saying what you think, and then asking what they think.\nIt may take some men longer to accept that they have prostate cancer than others. Their initial response could be disbelief, denial or shock. They might find it hard to take in information about their cancer or accept help. It may help to give them information in small chunks, at times when they seem ready to take it in.\nYou could let them know that you are there for them if they need anything. Be specific about the kind of support you can offer \u2013 practical as well as emotional. You might need to give them space to come to terms with things in their own time or deal with things in their own way.\nFor some men just having family and friends around is enough. You don\u2019t always have to talk about prostate cancer. Just chatting about normal things and doing some everyday activities together might help. Encourage your loved one to see family and friends and to keep up with social activities and hobbies if they feel up to it.\nWhen someone you\u2019re close to is unwell, it\u2019s natural to try to protect them and make their life as easy as possible. But a lot of men will want to keep doing things for themselves and to stay active.\nMany men with prostate cancer say they want to keep things as normal as possible. They may want to manage any side effects, or changes they\u2019re experiencing, themselves. This is called self-management. It means being actively involved in looking after your own health and wellbeing. For example, changing your diet, getting more active or learning other ways to look after yourself. It also involves being aware of any changes to your health and letting your doctor or nurse know about them.\nBut not all men will want, or be able, to make changes to their lifestyle. For some it may take a long time to make any changes, especially if they\u2019ve been doing something for a long time. But remember that making small changes gradually can still make a big difference to their health and the way they feel. Supporting your loved one to make positive lifestyle changes can help keep them motivated.\nSelf Management UK runs courses for people who want to take control of their health, including courses for carers.\nYou might be able to go along to appointments with your loved one. Men often say they like having someone with them for company and to help remember information. Attending appointments with your loved one may also help you feel more involved in his care and treatment.\nSome men find it helps if someone talks to the health professional for them. But only do this if he asks you to. Some people like to take notes, or you could ask to record the conversation using a phone or another recording device. This is often a good way to keep track of important details and means your loved one can go back over what was said in their own time. They have the right to record their appointment if they want to, because it's their personal data. But let the doctor or nurse know if and why you're recording them, as not everyone is comfortable being recorded.\nIf you\u2019re going to be waiting a long time for appointments or treatments, take some things to do. For example, travel games or cards, magazines, books and crosswords. Or you could listen to music or watch films if you have a smart phone, laptop or tablet.\nIf you\u2019re concerned about anything to do with the treatment your loved one is getting, talk to their doctor or nurse.\nIf you\u2019re raising any concerns without your loved one\u2019s knowledge, the doctors and nurses can listen to your concerns, but they might need to tell him about the conversation if it affects his care and treatment. Other services where you can raise concerns include:\nYou might be able to get help with the cost of travel to and from hospital, and hospital parking. This varies depending on where you live. Some people are eligible for free hospital transport. To find out more, talk to the hospital that is caring for your loved one, or his GP, or contact Macmillan Cancer Support. Some hospitals have a support and information service that may also have information about local travel costs and parking.\nA carer is someone who provides unpaid support to a family member or friend. Caring can include helping with day-to-day tasks such as housework, providing transport, or giving emotional support.\nSome people who care for someone with prostate cancer also provide medical and personal care. For example, help with using a catheter after surgery, organising medicines, ordering incontinence pads, or help with washing or dressing.\nIf you are providing this type of care, make sure you\u2019re getting all the help available to you.

You might also be able to arrange to have other care staff visit you at home. You can arrange this through your GP or ask the health professionals at the hospital.\nThe levels of care that your loved one needs may change over time. You might have managed fine in the past and not needed any help caring for him. But this may change from time to time, and some weeks may feel harder than others. If you find you\u2019re having a bad week or caring for your loved one is becoming too much, get advice and support from health professionals. Speak to our Specialist Nurses or another organisation.\nCaring can be tiring and sometimes stressful, so remember to look after yourself.\nAs a carer you might take over some of your loved one's usual activities, but try not to take on too much. This will help make sure that you don\u2019t get too tired and will help your loved one keep their independence and some normal routine to their day-to-day life.\nIf you could do with some extra help at home, speak to your GP or contact your local council and ask about social services. You can ask social services to assess your loved one\u2019s needs \u2013 and your own needs if you are providing them with care.

Carers Trust and Crossroads Caring Scotland have professional carers who can provide respite care in your home, if you decide to go away for a short time.\nApplying for support sometimes means filling in forms. For help with this, contact your local Citizens Advice or Macmillan Cancer Support.\nYour loved one might decide to reduce their working hours, or stop working completely if the side effects of treatment are making it difficult to work.\nIf you\u2019re caring for someone with prostate cancer, you may also think about reducing your working hours. Think about telling your manager that someone you are close to has cancer, as you may be entitled to time off or flexible working. If you're worried about talking to your manager, remember that everyone has their own worries and health problems from time to time. Most people will be understanding and will want to support you. Arrange a time to talk to your manager, and try working out a plan together.\nIf you or your partner reduce your working hours this could affect your financial situation. You may be entitled to certain benefits and grants. It can help to get some financial advice to make sure you\u2019re getting all the help you need. \nThe following organisations offer more information.                      \nThe diagnosis of a loved one can have a big impact on your life and it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll also have a lot on your mind.

If you need to speak to someone immediately, ring the Samaritans.\nUncertainty about the future\nIt\u2019s natural to find it difficult and upsetting to think about the future, particularly if your loved one has advanced prostate cancer. Many men with prostate cancer will have treatment that keeps the cancer under control for many years, but the outlook for some men won\u2019t be as good.\nYou might find that making plans helps you feel more prepared for what the future may hold, and reassured about the future for your family. But you may also find it difficult to make plans, especially if you\u2019re not sure how your loved one\u2019s prostate cancer may change. Your own personal plans, such as work or holidays, may also change, which some people find frustrating or upsetting.\nTalking about the future isn\u2019t always easy and you may feel worried about how to bring up the subject with your loved one.

There\u2019s no right or wrong way to deal with your feelings. Everyone has their own way of coping.\nGet support for yourself\nSome people struggle to deal with things on their own. It might be difficult to talk to the person you\u2019re supporting about how you are feeling \u2013 especially if they are dealing with their own emotions.

There are a number of ways you can get help and support for yourself, including:\nOther things that could help\nExamples of other things that might help include:\nPeople close to someone with cancer sometimes find that their own health gets worse.

Keeping things from them might only make them worry more. Children can often sense that something is wrong, even if they don\u2019t understand it. They may also notice that things at home have changed, such as their day-to-day routine. This can be confusing, especially for younger children.\nWhat they'll need to know about cancer and how they will react will depend on their age and whether they've known someone with an illness before.
