{"pageContent": "The Chemohormonal Therapy vs Androgen Ablation Randomized Trial for Extensive Disease in Prostate Cancer (CHAARTED) was a randomized phase III trial that evaluated the outcomes of men with metastatic prostate cancer who received castration with or without docetaxel. Patients from this trial were genotyped in a recent study to detect HSD3B1 variance and to determine 2-y freedom from castration-resistant prostate cancer as well as overall survival. The results of this study identified HSD3B1 as a possible biomarker that can be used to predict response to therapy in patients with metastatic disease.", "metaData": {"source": "Treatment of prostate cancer in obese patients\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17024870/"}}
