{"pageContent": "Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has a deleterious effect on sexual functions and general well-being in men. Despite this evidence, however, patient and couple knowledge about ADT side effects as well as their management is poor. Similar considerations can be made for physician endorsement of management strategies. In this paper, we summarize and critically discuss available evidence regarding the possible associations between ADT and sexual dysfunction as well as the best therapeutical options. Preclinical data show that ADT is associated with penile contractility impairment as well as lower response to phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i). Available data indicate that ADT resulted in a five to sixfold increased risk of reduced libido and in a threefold increased risk of ED confirming the main role of testosterone in regulating sexual desire. Despite this evidence, sexuality remains an important aspect of health and well-being for men and their partner. The best therapeutical options depend on patient and couple desires and needs. When nonpenetrative erections are still possible, nonpenetrative activities should be encouraged to maintain sexual intimacy. A combined and personal educational program including the collaboration of different professional figures (including general physicians, oncologists, andrologists, sexologists, and psychologists) trained in sexual medicine is advisable in order to provide the best support to subjects undergoing ADT.", "metaData": {"source": "The prevalence and nature of orgasmic dysfunction after radical prostatectomy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15329121/"}}
