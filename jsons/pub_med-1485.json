{"pageContent": "Erectile dysfunction remains a common complication following radical prostatectomy. The CaverMap Surgical Aid (UroMed, Boston, MA) was designed to aid the surgeon in identifying and preserving neurovascular bundles (NVBs). However, the size of the CaverMap nerve stimulator may make it difficult to trace the cavernous nerves before the prostate is removed, particularly in obese men or in patients who have a large prostate or a narrow pelvis. In a randomized, controlled study, the use of the CaverMap during radical prostatectomy resulted in improved nocturnal erections, but did not lead to improved overall sexual function. The CaverMap device, however, may be useful as a research tool in that it helps determine whether the NVBs have been successfully preserved after removing the prostate. However, preservation of the NVB does not guarantee recovery of potency, which may be prolonged despite successful stimulation of the cavernous nerves intraoperatively. This suggests that erectile dysfunction following radical prostatectomy is multifactorial.", "metaData": {"source": "Patient-Reported Outcomes Through 5 Years for Active Surveillance, Surgery, Brachytherapy, or External Beam Radiation With or Without Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31935027/"}}
