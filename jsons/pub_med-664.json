{"pageContent": "Objectives: Different artificial neural networks (ANNs) using total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and percentage of free PSA (%fPSA) have been introduced to enhance the specificity of prostate cancer detection. The applicability of independently trained ANN and logistic regression (LR) models to different populations regarding the composition (screening versus referred) and different PSA assays has not yet been tested.", "metaData": {"source": "[Salvage prostate brachytherapy: A solution for local failures after a primary radiation therapy?]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29122512/"}}
