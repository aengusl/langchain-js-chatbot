{"pageContent": "Given its long natural history, prostate cancer has become an ideal model for the clinical and basic science study of neoplastic disease in distinct pathologic phases: tumor initiation, progression, invasion, and metastasis. Chronic or recurrent acute inflammation, a product of infectious agents or other sources, has potential promotional roles in each of these phases. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), because of their ability to attenuate inflammation, as well as possibly direct anti-cancer properties associated with the inhibition of stromal cyclooxygenase-2, are potential candidates for clinical use in prostate cancer. Though epidemiologic evidence indicating a reduced risk of prostate cancer for NSAID users supports a chemoprotective benefit, observational assessment and clinical trials of these agents among large cohorts of prostate cancer patients are needed to determine their value in prostate cancer management.", "metaData": {"source": "Hormonotherapy of advanced prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15923436/"}}
