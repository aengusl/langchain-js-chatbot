{"pageContent": "Introduction: Current treatment options for prostate cancer, other than active surveillance, are limited to entire prostate gland destruction through removal (radical prostatectomy), radiation (external beam, brachytherapy, or a combination of both), or thermal ablation (cryoablation, high-intensity focused ultrasound, or radiofrequency).
