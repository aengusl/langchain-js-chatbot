{"pageContent": "It is a paradigm in cancer treatment that early detection and treatment improves survival. However, although screening measures lead to a higher rate of detection, for small bulk localised prostate cancer it remains unclear whether early detection and early treatment will lead to an overall decrease in mortality. The management options include surveillance, radiotherapy, and radical prostatectomy but there is no evidence base to evaluate the benefits of each approach. Advanced prostate cancer is managed by hormonal therapy. There have been major changes in treatment over the last two decades with the use of more humane treatment and developments in both chemotherapy and radiation. In this article we review the natural history and management of prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate specific antigen as an outcome variable for T1 and T2 prostate cancer treated by radiation therapy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7523725/"}}
