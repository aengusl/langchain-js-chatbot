{"pageContent": "We report a 62 years old kidney transplant (KT) patient who was diagnosed of localized prostatic cancer (PC) after 6 years of the implant. Transrectal prostatic High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) was applied. Results have been satisfactory, achieving pathologic and biochemical success. The discharge was completed at 24 hs, the morbidity was minimal. We have not found any reference in the literature on the appliance of HIFU in PC KT patients. We think that HIFU may represent a good alternative for these patients.", "metaData": {"source": "Regarding: 'High-intensity-focused ultrasound in the treatment of primary prostate cancer: the first UK series'\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19997112/"}}
