{"pageContent": "The increasing popularity of brachytherapy for treatment of early-stage prostate cancer requires oncology nurses to have a comprehensive knowledge of the disease, its treatment, and management of side effects. Because quality-of-life (QOL) issues have become an important consideration in treatment selection for many patients, oncology nurses must have a thorough understanding of these QOL issues and their management.
