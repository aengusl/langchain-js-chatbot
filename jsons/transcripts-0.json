{"pageContent": " foreign today we're talking about psma this has been a really popular scan on our Channel actually we have multiple questions about it but first of all can you give a context for what a psma scan is I've characterized it as the biggest Discovery since PSA and why is that well it's a a scan that only lights up for prostate cancer I mean there are rare exceptions to that and it is quite sensitive in other words it can pick up much smaller amounts of cancer than anything we've had previously both\n inside the prostate and in the rest of the body so for the first time we have a much more authoritative look at whether the cancer has spread people could say we've had bone scans and CAT scans for a long time but the amount of cancer that was needed to be seen on those scans was like maybe a half inch or a chunk of cancer that's like a billion cancer cells the early detection of metastasis with older scans like CAT scans and Bone scans was not really early now with the psma pet scans we can pick up things much much smaller and the\n possibility then of treating metastatic sites and even curing people with early metastasis is on the table now so we have a lot of people who are new to the prostate space and there's a lot of terms that they're having to learn and one of them we oftentimes talk about PET CT or maybe they hear PET CT from their doctor but now they're hearing psma pet and so what is the difference between those two well there are other types of pet scans and this is why the Pismo pet technology has been adopted so quickly\n throughout the country as we've had pet scans for breast cancer and lung cancer and lymphomas for many years and they were very useful a couple years ago they came up with a serviceable pet scan called an aximum pet scan which also can find earlier stage prostate cancer not with the same precision as as a psma but it was useful so all the infrastructures out there across the country for doing pet scanning and when psma came along that pre-existing infrastructure could be utilized and so it's it's come on very quickly so these\n different pet scans are well let's say comparing psma and Axle and pet scans the psma is a more sensitive scan there are relatively uncommon prostate cancers that don't make psma about 10 percent of prostate cancers so a maximum pet scan might be a good fallback position in those individuals but psmas can find cancer sometimes with PSAs as low as 0.\n 2 whereas the maximum pet scan you probably need a minimum PSA of around one before you're going to start to pick anything up so that's one example of different pet scans there's also fdg pet scans which are um used mainly for lung Cancers and lymphomas rarely we'll pick something up with prostate cancer we have F-18 pet bone scans which are sensitive indicators of irritation of the bones and can pick up early metastasis unfortunately most insurance companies aren't covering them they aren't\n utilized very much so there's a whole arrange of pet scans out there but psma sort of sits at the top of the mountain as the as the ideal scan and these other scans are going to have utilities sometimes in exceptional cases but when we talk about pet scans in the prostate cancer world now we really need to be talking about a psma pet scan so you had mentioned with an axumin scan that the PSM PSA needs to be at least one so what is the lowest PSA you could see for a psma for it to pick up cancer well in the hormone sensitive patients which is\n where most of these scans are being utilized you're looking at a threshold of about 0.2 and you'll maybe pick up some something and about 20 percent of individuals with PSAs that low as the PSA goes higher say up to 0.5 you'll find prostate cancer maybe in about half of those patients and as the PSA gets up above one you're looking at maybe 90 percent of patients you'll find the prostate cancer whether it's in the prostate or outside the prostate other than costs is there a reason that upon\n diagnosing somebody with prostate cancer they're not doing a Dre a PSA test and then also doing a psma scan to check to see if somebody has prostate cancer other than cost and then perhaps ignorance it's a new test and so some of the doctors still are unaware of this technology sadly the many of the private insurances are not covering psma pet scans yet either even for relapsed or for newly diagnosed very disappointing because this is such breakthrough technology and it gives much more accurate information\n Medicare has been very generous in covering psma pet scans for both perhaps the newly diagnosed patients just have to have a diagnosis of prostate cancer for coverage so we're very grateful for that one question we get quite often is does psma pick up all types of prostate cancers is there any cancer that it doesn't pick up yeah there are certain types of prostate cancer that don't make psma and that is something to keep in mind people have been using scans to try and avoid biopsies so if someone\n has a spot seen on MRI or high PSA since it's a disease specific scan it's attractive to think about well let's just do a PS my pet scan and make sure there's no cancer present and that if the Pismo pet scan is clear maybe you don't need a biopsy and the psma pet scans are about 90 percent accurate so that's pretty good but not perfect so there will be some question as to the possibility of a prostate cancer that's not utilizing psma or doesn't have psma on its surface and so the scan's not a\n hundred percent accurate so in those cases for those 10 where the prostate the cancer cells are not creating a psma antigen like what what is done like what do people do in order to check for that 10 I don't know this is such new technology I'm not sure there is a uniform policy the vast majority of men when they have high PSAs or abnormal MRIs are getting prostate biopsies and so that would possibly be necessary to undergo a targeted biopsy if something has been seen on an MRI so if somebody High psma scan and the cancer is shown\n to be localized to the prostate they don't see any sort of metastatic activity outside of it the person's wondering what the negative predictive value would be of not having metastasis later is this a really good sign is it based off the Gleason score what does that look like it is based off the Gleason score so it seems like the statistics are coming in as follows that in the people that have what we call high-risk prostate cancer or Azure and the methodology at the pcri chances that there's something outside the prostate\n that's being missed by the psma Pet Scan is about one in five and if someone has an intermediate risk or what we call a teal and the pcri staging system the chance that there's something outside the prostate that's being missed by the PSA pet scan is probably around one in ten somebody had a psma pet scan and it said that they had extra capsular extension so they're wondering if that's the same as locally Advanced and the doctor told them they had locally advance but they saw that on the scan\n and they're wondering what the definition between terms would be I think they're synonymous terms but I would like to comment on this concern about locally Advanced disease or extra capsule extension historically and I think this is sort of a surgical point of view if there was anything outside the prostate the Assumption was that those individuals are at higher risk of developing developing metastasis and of course the development of metastasis is a watershed event that's really what defines what is dangerous about any kind\n of cancer including prostate cancer that assumption that extra capsule extension or locally Advanced disease translates into a higher risk of metastasis hasn't really been borne out in studies and uh I won't go into the reason that it was previously believed to be you know a danger for metastasis if you had some extra capsule extension or ECE you know there's a reason that people used to think that but now we know that the risk of metastatic spread is much more based on the grade of the cancer than where\n it's located if it's coming through the edge of the prostate or not the chances for metastasis is going to be based on the Gleason score not on whether or not there's some extra capsular extension so another patient has a question regarding the timing of their psma scan so they've already had a shot of Lupron and they're wondering can they have a psma after they've already received some form of treatment or will it alter the results or the fact that it altered it doesn't matter well that's\n very it's an interesting thing because historically with CAT scans and Bone scans we were counseling people to ensure that they postpone any hormone tree but until after the scans because prostate cancer is a very hormone sensitive cancer answer and you could erase the spots and if there were spots outside the metastatic lesions you would want to know about it and take appropriate measures it appears that at least for the initial early months after people started hormone therapy it's that the uh manifestation of psma on the surface of\n the cancer cells actually can go up so there may be a small even advantage for fighting any metastatic lesions in people that have had some early exposure to hormone therapy I don't think this has been studied systematically and I don't know you know what sort of a delay and I'm I'm not counseling people to go on hormone therapy first and then have scans I'm sticking to the old standard approach of get all your staging done and then start your treatment but it is interesting that some researchers have\n pointed out that there can be an increase of psma on the surface of the cancer cells after they're exposed to Androgen deprivation and that theoretically could even make up spots of cancer light up more brightly at least for maybe a month or two after the initiation of hormone treatment speaking of hormone therapy and psma scans I think one of the biggest topics that we've talked about this year is shortening our courses of hormone therapy because of psma and maybe not going for the full 24 months or 18\n months can you speak to that yeah it's a challenge that we're all being faced with now with the Advent of of new technologies it takes years to develop protocols that everyone can agree show the optimal treatment plan and all the protocols that we have for giving hormone therapy to men who have intermediate or high-risk disease were developed in prospective trials that were performed over a 10-year period well we've only had piss made pet scans on the market now for less than a year and we don't have information in terms\n of what to expect in people that have negative and positive PSA pet scans if you think of these PSA pet scans what they are is a shortcut to staging all the previous staging of high risk and intermediate risk was all a statistical projection to to decide what's the likelihood of something being outside the prostate now we have scans that are basically telling us if there is anything outside the prostate and should we act on this new information or should we just stick to the old policies well one of the reasons to think about acting\n on this new information is the old policies would extract a high price in terms of quality of life taking hormone therapy for 18 months in a 70 year old man it translates more into like 30 months because there's a slow recovery and so being without testosterone for extended periods of time to maybe improve cure rates five or ten percent is of questionable value so I think it's something that needs to be explained to patients that if they're thinking of very long-term hormone therapy which would be a standard approach in people\n with high risk or Azure prostate cancer then they need to be educated as to how much the Cure rates will actually improve in light of the fact that psma pet scan isn't showing anything outside the prostate and it may be a relatively small percentage and some people will say I don't want to take hormone therapy for that amount of time just to get an extra five to eight percent cure rate on the other hand if psma pet scans do show something outside the prostate we know that that in that individual it is a proven fact\n that there the biology of their cancer has the ability to spread around the body which is what makes any cancer dangerous and in those individuals you can see that you might argue for even stronger treatment that not only a mere 18 months of hormone therapy but maybe even a short course of chemotherapy so this has a huge impact there are no uniform policies right now people have to think on their feet and decide you know with this new information do I really want to be as aggressive previously if I don't have any spread of\n the disease this is really good news doesn't that mean that I can back off on the intensity of the therapy a little bit thank you so much for watching this video on psma pet scans the reason we're bringing this to your attention is because psma is a new technology it may not be widespread throughout the medical community yet and we want you to bring this up to your doctor so that you guys can make the best treatment decisions no matter where you're at in your journey thank you so much for allowing us to be\n here for you as you know that maybe you don't know pcri is a 501c3 nonprofit all of these videos

making it possible to treat metastatic sites and potentially cure early metastasis.\nPSMA scan is different from other types of PET scans, such as Axumin and FDG, and is considered the ideal scan for prostate cancer.\nNot all types of prostate cancer make PSMA, and the accuracy of PSMA scan is about 90%.\nThe use of PSMA scan can impact treatment decisions, including the duration and intensity of hormone therapy and chemotherapy.", "metaData": {"source": "How PSMA Revolutionizes Staging for #prostatecancer | #markscholzmd | #PCRI - YouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBILHS0FJfk"}}
