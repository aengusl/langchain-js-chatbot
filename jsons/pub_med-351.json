{"pageContent": "HIFU therapy is one of epoch-making, low-invasive treatments for prostate cancer. We investigated 71 patients who had undergone HIFU therapy from June 2004 through September 2005. We mainly gave a single spinal injection followed by epidural catheterization with a combined spinal-epidural anesthesia kit. Three patients received general anesthesia because of various problems such as allergy for local anesthetics, ankylosing spondylitis and severe spinal deformity causing difficulty in lumbar puncture. Spinal anesthesia was successfully achieved in most patients. Twelve patients with insufficient anesthetic levels required additional local anesthetics via epidural catheters. We found no serious perioperative complications.", "metaData": {"source": "[High-intensity focussed ultrasound in low-risk prostate cancer - oncological outcome and postinterventional quality of life of an inexperienced therapy centre in comparison with an experienced therapy centre]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23888408/"}}
