{"pageContent": "Purpose of review: Prostate cancer is now the most commonly diagnosed solid tumor in American men. Autopsy studies show the uniquely high prevalence rates of small, indolent tumors in men dying of other causes. These findings have led to an increased interest in managing men with prostate cancer and low risk features expectantly, with close observation for early signs of progression. This approach allows one to limit prostate cancer treatment and any risk of related morbidity to the men who will benefit the most from active intervention.", "metaData": {"source": "Early prostate cancer care questioned\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25189017/"}}
