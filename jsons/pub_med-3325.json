{"pageContent": "Detectable prostate-specific antigen levels (PSA) following radical prostatectomy (RP) are believed to represent treatment failure. In this retrospective review, we characterize long-term PSA outcomes following RP (n = 204) in a non-referral hospital performed between 1984 and 1994. With an average follow-up of 10 y, 90 (44%) patients developed a PSA recurrence: 15 (17%) died of prostate cancer despite hormonal intervention, 39 (43%) responded to hormonal therapy with stable remission and 36 (40%) were observed without intervention. Following RP many patients may have a detectable PSA that does not require treatment. PSA doubling time (< 12 months) was the best predictor of disease progression.", "metaData": {"source": "A 3-y prospective study of health-related and disease-specific quality of life in patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy or external beam radiotherapy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15111981/"}}
