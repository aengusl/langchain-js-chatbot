{"pageContent": "The mainstay of treatment for men with three or fewer non-castrate metastatic lesions outside of the prostate remains morbid palliative androgen deprivation therapy. We believe there is now a significant body of retrospective literature to suggest a survival benefit if these men have radical treatment to their primary tumour alongside 'metastasis-directed therapy' to the metastatic deposits. However, this regimen should be reserved to high-volume centres with quality assurance programmes and excellent outcomes.
