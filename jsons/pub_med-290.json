{"pageContent": "Study Type--Therapy (case series) Level of Evidence 4. What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy has been proposed for the treatment of localized prostate cancer (PCa) for all risk levels of tumour recurrence. The study adds data on the efficacy of a single HIFU application in the treatment of PCa with different risks of recurrence. Durable cancer control was achieved in 81.7% of patients with low-risk disease, with rates of efficacy declining in intermediate- and high-risk tumours. The data suggest that the principal domain for minimal invasive HIFU should be low-risk disease.", "metaData": {"source": "Seven years of experience with high-intensity focused ultrasound for prostate cancer: advantages and limitations\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22253052/"}}
