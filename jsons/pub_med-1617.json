{"pageContent": "Relatively little attention has been focused on the reproductive and sexual function issues faced by men with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Infertility in men with IBD can be caused by medications used to treat the disease (most notably sulfasalazine), by active inflammation, and by the poor nutritional status that can result from IBD. Sexual function can be adversely affected by some medications used to treat IBD, by the depression that can accompany active IBD, and by proctocolectomy. When men with IBD do father children, there appears to be no increased rate of adverse fetal outcomes. Screening for prostate cancer after proctocolectomy can be challenging, but current data support the use of prostate-specific antigen screening for these patients. This review serves as an outline to assist the clinician in discussing sexual and reproductive issues in male patients with IBD.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostatic capsule- and seminal-sparing cystectomy for bladder carcinoma: initial results for selected patients\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15541120/"}}
