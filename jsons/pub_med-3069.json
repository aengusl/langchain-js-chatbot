{"pageContent": "Given the lack of unequivocal survival data clearly favoring one treatment over another for localized prostate cancer, patients strongly consider quality-of-life effects when choosing treatment for this common malignancy. In the past 15 years, a sizeable body of literature assessing health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) outcomes in localized prostate cancer has emerged. The goal of this article is to review the quality-of-life experience after treatment for localized prostate cancer. Specifically, I will briefly discuss how quality of life is measured and then review the quality of life effects of each of the commonly used treatment strategies in localized prostate cancer. Finally, I attempt to directly compare the quality-of-life effects of the various treatments to assist clinicians in advising patients with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Defining clinically significant prostate cancer: pathologic criteria versus outcomes data\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8780622/"}}
