{"pageContent": "The treatment of prostate cancer is partly guided by patient preferences. Radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy are the standard radical therapies for localized disease and render comparable oncologic outcomes. Considering that survival is high regardless of the chosen treatment, factors such as treatment-related toxicities affecting the patients' quality of life play an important role in their decision. Notably, post-treatment sexual dysfunction, which includes decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory dysfunction has been shown to be an important and prevalent concern of prostate cancer survivors. In this literature review, we sought to characterize the sexual complications associated with radiation therapy and map the available sexual rehabilitation options for prostate cancer survivors experiencing sexual dysfunction as a result of radiation therapy. We identified medical, non-biomedical, counseling, and lifestyle modification options for prostate cancer survivors seeking sexual rehabilitation. Future research in this area should address the standardization of sexual side-effect reporting and investigate sexual outcomes and rehabilitation in more diverse groups and of transgender and nonheterosexual prostate cancer survivors.", "metaData": {"source": "Aspirin use and transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy: a national survey\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17437427/"}}
