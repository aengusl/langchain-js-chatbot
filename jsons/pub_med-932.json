{"pageContent": "Sexual recovery after prostate cancer (PCa) treatment is challenging. When expectations are that erectile response will quickly return to baseline, patients can often struggle when this does not happen. Further difficulty is experienced when patients encounter physical, psychological, and relational barriers to sexual adjustment. Drawing on the psychosocial research literature and on 15 years of clinical experience counseling PCa patients about sexual recovery, this paper outlines considerations for clinical practice. Suggestions include broadening the target for successful outcomes after Pca treatment beyond erectile function to include sexual distress and other sources of sexual concern. Clinicians are urged to consider individual differences such as the larger context of the patient, including their values and preferences, their treatment goals, and their relationship situation and status, in order to promote successful sexual adaptation. When introducing treatment approaches, the role of grief and loss should be assessed, and patients should be supported to foster realistic expectations about the recovery process. Suggestions for how to introduce various sexual strategies to patients are also offered, including ways to support patients in making and sustaining behavioral changes associated with sexual intervention. Clinicians are offered suggestions to promote patients' sexual flexibility, prevent long periods of sexual inactivity, and help patients to identify various sexual motivators. Consideration of these psychological, relational, and social factors are all likely to help facilitate better sexual outcomes for PCa patients.", "metaData": {"source": "The psychosocial aspects of sexual recovery after prostate cancer treatment\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19158798/"}}
