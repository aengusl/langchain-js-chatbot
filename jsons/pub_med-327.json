{"pageContent": "The article outlines oncological and functional outcomes of salvage external beam radiation therapy after HIFU-ablation in 49 patients. The study determined overall and relapse-free survival, compared the rates of adverse events stratified by CTCAE, erectile function and continence scores assessed by questionnaire survey. Univariate and multivariate analysis of risk factors for failure of salvage radiation therapy after prostate HIFU-ablation were conducted. In univariate analysis the level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) prior to radiotherapy, the risk group, PSA nadir after radiotherapy, PSA nadir greater than 0.2 ng/mL and the time to nadir after salvage therapy were predictors of failure. There were no serious gastrointestinal side effects. The most frequent urinary adverse event was urgency. The difference in the rates of urinary incontinence before and 1 year after radiotherapy was not statistically significant. The study confirmed the appropriateness of radiotherapy after HIFU-ablation. Radiation therapy can be considered as a treatment option for prostate cancer recurrence after HIFU-ablation.", "metaData": {"source": "[Localized prostate cancer treatment in renal transplant patient with high intensity focalized ultrasound (HIFU)]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15786766/"}}
