{"pageContent": "Purpose of review: While recurrence after primary treatment of prostate cancer (PCa) is not uncommon, there is currently no consensus on the most appropriate management after radiation treatment failure. This article seeks to explore the currently utilized modalities for salvage treatment for radiorecurrent PCa. We focused our review on the oncologic outcomes and reported toxicity rates in the latest studies examining salvage radical prostatectomy (SRP), salvage cryotherapy (SCT), salvage high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and re-irradiation.", "metaData": {"source": "Contrast-Enhanced Transrectal Ultrasound for Follow-up After Focal HIFU Ablation for Prostate Cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30117172/"}}
