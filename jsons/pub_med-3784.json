{"pageContent": "Meaningful changes to the approach of prostate cancer staging and management have been made over the past decade with increasing demand for high-quality multiparametric MR imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate. This article focuses on the evolving paradigm of prostate cancer staging, with emphasis on the role of mpMRI on staging and its integration into clinical decision making. Current prostate cancer staging systems are defined and mpMRI's role in the detection of non-organ-confined disease and how it has an impact on the selection of appropriate next steps are discussed. Several imaging pitfalls, limitations, and future directions of mpMRI also are discussed.", "metaData": {"source": "Decision making and prostate cancer screening\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24725488/"}}
