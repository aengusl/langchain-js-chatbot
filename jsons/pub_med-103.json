{"pageContent": "High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an emerging, noninvasive, local treatment of prostate cancer with 15 years of clinical experience, during which about 30,000 HIFU treatments have been performed worldwide. In this paper, we review relevant publications regarding the means by which new and old prostate cancer technologies are evaluated, the outcomes of HIFU by Ablatherm (EDAP TMS, Lyon, France), and the evolution currently underway regarding how prostate cancer is diagnosed and treated. We show the potential of HIFU to be used as local therapy for men with any stage of prostate cancer and how this additional therapeutic option can fit within the future armamentarium of a sequential multimodal therapy concept.", "metaData": {"source": "Magnetic resonance image-guided versus ultrasound-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound in the treatment of breast cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23237221/"}}
