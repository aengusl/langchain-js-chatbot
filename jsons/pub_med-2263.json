{"pageContent": "Estrogen receptor \u03b2 (ER\u03b2) is activated in the prostate by 5\u03b1-androstane-3\u03b2,17\u03b2-diol (3\u03b2-Adiol) where it exerts antiproliferative activity. The proliferative action of the androgen receptor is activated by 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Thus, prostate growth is governed by the balance between androgen receptor and ER\u03b2 activation. 3\u03b2-Adiol is a high-affinity ligand and agonist of ER\u03b2 and is derived from DHT by 3-keto reductase/3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes. Here, we demonstrate that, when it is expressed in living cells containing an estrogen response element-luciferase reporter, 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 6 (17\u03b2HSD6) converts the androgen DHT to the estrogen 3\u03b2-Adiol, and this leads to activation of the ER\u03b2 reporter. This conversion of DHT occurs at concentrations that are in the physiological range of this hormone in the prostate. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that 17\u03b2HSD6 is expressed in ER\u03b2-positive epithelial cells of the human prostate and that, in prostate cancers of Gleason grade higher than 3, both ER\u03b2 and 17\u03b2HSD6 are undetectable. Both proteins were present in benign prostatic hyperplasia samples. These observations reveal that formation of 3\u03b2-Adiol via 17\u03b2HSD6 from DHT is an important growth regulatory pathway that is lost in prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Comparison of health-related quality of life between subjects treated with radical prostatectomy and brachytherapy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22176735/"}}
