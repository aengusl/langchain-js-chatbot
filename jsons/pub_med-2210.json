(89)Zr-huJ591 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging was performed in patients with metastatic prostate cancer to analyze and validate this as an imaging biomarker for metastatic disease. The purpose of this initial study was to assess safety, biodistribution, normal organ dosimetry, and optimal imaging time post-injection for lesion detection.", "metaData": {"source": "What is the mechanism effect that links social support to coping and psychological outcome within individuals affected by prostate cancer?
