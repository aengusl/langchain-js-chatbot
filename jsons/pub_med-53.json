{"pageContent": "Purpose of review: Prostate cancer screening practices are providing new opportunities for earlier diagnosis, and for identifying smaller tumours with low probability of regional involvement and high likelihood of curability. Simultaneous innovations in tissue ablation technologies offer the potential for effective targeted treatments to discrete areas within the prostate, with negligible side-effects. This review provides an overview of recent data on developing options for prostate cancer ablation, the mechanisms of action of these modalities and results to date of these treatments.", "metaData": {"source": "Drivers for change in the management of prostate cancer - guidelines and new treatment techniques\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22672123/"}}
