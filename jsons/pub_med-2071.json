{"pageContent": "Male sexuality is a complex phenomenon shaped by personal, cultural,and social factors. This article has argued that male sexual function is an important consideration in conditions such as prostate cancer. There are surely other conditions where it is understood even more poorly. Although theorists tend to explore male sexuality in relation to vague concepts such as power, phallocentrism, and aggression, sexuality becomes a personal reality in illness contexts. Using insights from a study into prostate cancer, it has been suggested that men assess embodied risks, such as impotence, in highly individual ways. The uncertainty that characterizes this cancer further compounds the difficulties involved, despite attempts of professionals to provide adequate levels of information and support. Researchers and practitioners alike should begin to question the gap between theoretical constructions of male sexuality and its reality in healthcare situations. More attention should be paid to understanding the importance of sexual function for men who are living with conditions such as prostate cancer. Those men who face up to the threat of such embodied changes, and who learn to cope with physical and emotional (and sexual) vulnerability, may learn to evaluate their lives in new ways. As Kenneth, one of the participants in this study said of his experience of cancer, \"It just seems unnecessary for them to have to go through that to learn and understand themselves and be honest with themselves about what is really important.\"", "metaData": {"source": "Psychosocial adaptation in female partners of men with prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19686355/"}}
