{"pageContent": "Introduction: Current research on prostate cancer is heavily focused on early detection and new treatments. There is a lack of research on the overall morbidity prostate cancer survivors face and the amount of healthcare treatment they receive toward the end of their lives. Identifying these care needs will allow appropriate healthcare modeling, resource allocation and service re-design to ensure higher quality care toward the end of life. The aim of this study is to quantify and analyze the use of healthcare services by patients dying with but not necessarily of prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Strategies for living well with hormone-responsive advanced prostate cancer-a qualitative exploration\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32632762/"}}
