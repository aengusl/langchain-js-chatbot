{"pageContent": "The utility of reporter genes has gained significant momentum over the last three decades. Reporter genes are used to understand the transcriptional activity of a gene both in vitro and in vivo, and in pathway analysis and drug screening for diseases involving protozoan parasites, and in anti-cancer drug developments. Here, using a human prostate cancer xenograft model (PC3), we describe a method to construct and validate hypoxia reporter genes with different half-lives. Using molecular biology and optical imaging techniques, we have validated the expression of long half-life enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) expression and short half-life luciferase gene expression to report on the spatial and temporal evolution of hypoxia in vivo.", "metaData": {"source": "The cost-effectiveness of combined androgen blockade with bicalutamide and luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist in men with metastatic prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16006889/"}}
