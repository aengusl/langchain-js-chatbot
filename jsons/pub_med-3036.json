{"pageContent": "High-risk prostate cancer (PCa) refers to a very heterogeneous subgroup of disease. Recent series have shown very promising results of radical prostatectomy (RP)-alone or part as a multimodality approach-in patients with high-risk PCa, with satisfactory survival curves even though biochemical recurrence rate was high. Adjuvant treatment (radiotherapy (RT) alone or combined with androgen deprivation) was necessary in 20 to 54 % of patients, notably in cases with positive surgical margins. As for functional outcomes, urinary continence was preserved in about 92 % of cases and overall potency in 60 %. When comparing RP versus RT as primary treatment for high-risk PCa, a recent meta-analysis found surgery to be associated with an improved cancer-specific mortality compared with RT. In selected high-risk PCa young patients, surgery appears to be a valid option. Patients should however be informed of the possibility of adjuvant treatment, as part of a multimodal approach.", "metaData": {"source": "Five-year oncological outcomes of endoscopic extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy (EERPE) for prostate cancer: results from a medium-volume UK centre\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23980640/"}}
