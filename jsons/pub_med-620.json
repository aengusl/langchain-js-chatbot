{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer represents the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and is the second-leading cause of cancer related death in the United States. Primary treatment for prostate cancer includes radiotherapy or ablative procedures such as cryotherapy, and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). Unfortunately, a large proportion of these patients, especially with high risk features, may experience disease recurrence within 10 years. Management of recurrent localized prostate cancer is heterogeneous, and radical surgery remains as a salvage option in these patients. The purpose of this article is to offer oncological arguments in favor of salvage robotic radical prostatectomy (sRARP), which could benefit a certain group of patients. Tips and tricks in order to perform a challenging salvage surgery are summarized, as evidence of modern series with acceptable morbidity rates.", "metaData": {"source": "Can color doppler predict the uniformity of HIFU-induced prostate tissue destruction?\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15264239/"}}
