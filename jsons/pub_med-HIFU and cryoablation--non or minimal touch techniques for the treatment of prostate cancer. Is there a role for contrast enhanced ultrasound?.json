{"pageContent": "Background: Patients with (local) recurrence of prostate cancer after radiation therapy face the question of the appropriate diagnostic and possible therapeutic options. Many patients in this setting receive palliative androgen deprivation therapy alone, with arguable impact on overall cancer survival. In the case of an isolated local recurrence, salvage prostatectomy represents a potentially curative therapeutic option, albeit with a high complication rate. Alternatively, these patients can be offered a local treatment with salvage HIFU therapy.", "metaData": {"source": "HIFU and cryoablation--non or minimal touch techniques for the treatment of prostate cancer.
