{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is the number one malignancy among men. The search for causative factors has proven to be difficult and, accordingly, treatment options for advanced prostate cancer remain limited. However, technologic breakthroughs in the fields of genetics and molecular biology have advanced our understanding of the mechanisms involved in prostate carcinogenesis. The aim of this article is to review the most recent evidence for the role of various genetic insults at specific steps in tumor formation and to suggest potential therapeutic targets.", "metaData": {"source": "Treatment of prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10380061/"}}
