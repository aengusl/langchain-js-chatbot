{"pageContent": "As a result of widespread serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening and prostate cancer awareness, the detection of low-grade prostate cancer has increased. At the moment, it is unclear how to treat patients in this population. Thus, we focused on reviewing therapies for patients in this low risk group. The purpose of this review paper is to present the status of emerging therapies of cryotherapy and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in patients with low risk disease. Based on our review of the literature, there are several small-scale studies of these two therapies that have revealed favorable outcomes, but with complications of urinary incontinence and impotence. With further research, these therapies may develop into good alternatives for patients in this expanding group.", "metaData": {"source": "Role of imaging and biopsy to assess local recurrence after definitive treatment for prostate carcinoma (surgery, radiotherapy, cryotherapy, HIFU)\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21553276/"}}
