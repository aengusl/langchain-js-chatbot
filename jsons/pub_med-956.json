{"pageContent": "Androgens play a prominent role in the development, maintenance and progression of prostate cancer. The introduction of androgen deprivation therapies into the treatment paradigm for prostate cancer patients has resulted in a wide variety of benefits ranging from a survival advantage for those with clinically localized or locally advanced disease, to improvements in symptom control for patients with advanced disease. Controversies remain, however, surrounding the optimal timing, duration and schedule of these hormonal approaches. Newer hormonal manipulations such as abiraterone acetate have also been investigated and will broaden treatment options for men with prostate cancer. This review highlights the various androgen-directed treatment options available to men with prostate cancer, their specific indications and the evidence supporting each approach, as well as patterns of use of hormonal therapies.", "metaData": {"source": "Erectile dysfunction following radiotherapy and brachytherapy for prostate cancer: pathophysiology, prevention and treatment\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17960489/"}}
