{"pageContent": "With advancements in diagnostic techniques, including molecular and clinical imaging, that directly target cancer cells, oligometastatic prostate cancer (PCa) is being diagnosed in patients who were, in the past, considered to have localized disease. With accumulating evidence, there has been a paradigm shift in considering aggressive treatments targeted at both the primary tumor and metastatic lesions in an aim to avoid and delay the need for palliative treatments and, ultimately, to achieve survival benefits. However, many questions still remain unanswered regarding the understanding of oligometastatic PCa, from its definition to optimal treatment strategies for each individual. Limited retrospective studies have suggested that interventions, including local and/or metastasis-directed therapy using surgery and radiation therapy (RT), can improve survival outcomes with minimal risk of adverse effects. Such treatments have been shown to decrease the risks of subsequent palliative interventions and to delay the start of androgen-deprivation therapy. Nevertheless, available data are insufficient to draw a reliable conclusion regarding their effect on quality of life measures and overall survival. This comprehensive review overviews data from contemporary literature that have investigated treatments, including surgery and RT, for patients with oligometastatic PCa, namely pelvic lymph node positive disease and limited distant metastases, and summarizes ongoing trials that are evaluating the feasibility of aggressive multimodal treatments.", "metaData": {"source": "Early oncological outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for high-grade prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21392212/"}}
