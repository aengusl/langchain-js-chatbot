{"pageContent": "Objectives: Brachytherapy is a widely used treatment for localized prostate cancer (CaP) and is only appropriate as monotherapy for low-risk cancer. The predicted response to therapy is defined by the pretreatment parameters, of which the biopsy Gleason grade is central. However, the biopsy grade often misrepresents the true pathologic grade. We examined the impact of incorrect biopsy grading on brachytherapy outcomes.", "metaData": {"source": "Radiation-based approaches to the management of T3 prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9421450/"}}
