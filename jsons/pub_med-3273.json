{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is among the most common cancers. Although it has a relatively good prognosis, 15 to 30% of men with prostate cancer experience a relapse after radical prostatectomy. Identifying patients with an aggressive tumor will therefore help to improve prostate cancer management. DNA methylation of PITX2 has been established in several studies as a prognostic biomarker for breast and prostate cancer. These case control studies were conducted using research assay components; to facilitate its use in a diagnostic setting, the PITX2 biomarker was transferred to a validated diagnostic platform, the Affymetrix GeneChip System. A customized microarray (Epichip PITX2) was designed using features in high redundancy to ensure a robust determination of the methylation state of the PITX2 promoter. The developed method allowed for accurate assessment of prognosis in prostate cancer patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. Determination of PITX2 methylation in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue samples from a cohort of 157 prostatectomy patients resulted in an excellent level of concordance of the clinical classification, as well as the measured output between the research assay and the Epichip PITX2. These analytical performance results describe the Epichip PITX2 as a robust and reliable diagnostic tool for assessing the methylation status of PITX2, enabling an improved outcome prediction in cancer patients following radical prostatectomy.", "metaData": {"source": "Tools for predicting patient-reported outcomes in prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy: a systematic review of prognostic accuracy and validity\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28585573/"}}
