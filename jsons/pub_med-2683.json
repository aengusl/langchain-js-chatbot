{"pageContent": "Data from the past 6 years have shown that the presence of any amount of cribriform (or more comprehensively, large acinar cribriform to papillary) pattern of invasive prostate cancer is associated with adverse pathologic features and leads to uniquely adverse outcomes. Sixteen papers and numerous abstracts have reached these conclusions concordantly. Not only does this justify removal of all cribriform cancer from Gleason grade 3, it shows that cribriform cancer has pathologic, outcome, and molecular features distinct from noncribriform Gleason grade 4. Suggestions for accommodating the presence of cribriform cancer into the 2014 Grade Group scheme are proposed.", "metaData": {"source": "Purposeful interaction: ways Latino men communicate about prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23107854/"}}
