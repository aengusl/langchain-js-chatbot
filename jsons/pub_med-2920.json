Existing studies lack long-term outcome data. We conducted this study to assess the impact of racial differences on risk profile and oncologic outcomes in a large cohort of patients with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate-specific antigen level, stage or Gleason score: which is best for predicting outcomes after radical prostatectomy, and does it vary by the outcome being measured?
