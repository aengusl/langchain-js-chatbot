{"pageContent": "Intra-fraction motion of the prostate was recorded during 721 fractions of image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) in 28 patients, 14 of which were treated by intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and 14 of which were treated by volumetric arc therapy (VMAT). The prostate was imaged by three-dimensional and time-resolved transperineal ultrasound (4D-US) of type Clarity by Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden. The prostate volume was registered and the prostate position (center of volume) was recorded at a frequency of 1.6 samples per second. This raw data set contains a total of 380.199 prostate and patient couch positions over a time span of 53 hours, 47 minutes and 29 seconds of life radiotherapy as exported by the instrument software. This data set has been used for the validation of models of prostate intra-fraction motion and for the estimation of the dosimetric impact of actual intra-fraction motion on treatment quality and side effects. We hope that this data set may be reused by other groups for similar purposes.", "metaData": {"source": "Do contemporary imaging and biopsy techniques reliably identify unilateral prostate cancer?
