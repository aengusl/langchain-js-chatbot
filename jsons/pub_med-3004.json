{"pageContent": "The relative success of radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy is discussed for the treatment of prostate cancer. Obstacles to this comparison included changing criteria for treatment, variations in endpoint reporting and data analysis, the lack of help from retrospective trials, the confusion caused by concurrent hormonal manipulation, and the influences of patient and tumor factors.
