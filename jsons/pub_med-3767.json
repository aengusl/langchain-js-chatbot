{"pageContent": "The discovery of TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions in prostate cancer dramatically changed our view of solid tumors. Unveiling the molecular principles of the fusion illustrates the potential for clinical applications with regard to prognosis, diagnosis and therapy. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions and delineate how genetic analysis of fusion positive prostate cancer cases can be used as a prognostic marker in clinical routine. The characteristic morphological features of the gene fusion and its detection in prostate biopsies and in urine make it a promising target to identify aggressive tumors. By increasing our knowledge about fusion positive prostate cancer, we will improve the possibility to offer target specific and individualized therapeutic approaches.", "metaData": {"source": "Focal therapy for prostate cancer: opportunities and uncertainties\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21955852/"}}
