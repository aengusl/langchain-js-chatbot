{"pageContent": "Erectile dysfunction is a common side-effect of prostate cancer surgery that causes men suffering and hinders their sexual recovery. There are studies that describe men's and partners' distress and couples' difficulties engaging in sexual recovery. A few studies show a short-term benefit of brief psycho-social interventions such as psychoeducation and counseling. However, there is no conceptual framework to guide psychosocial treatments. We propose a model of intervention in sexual recovery that incorporates grief and mourning as a gateway to new and satisfying sexuality after prostate cancer treatment.", "metaData": {"source": "Safety of ultrasound-guided transrectal extended prostate biopsy in patients receiving low-dose aspirin\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20602823/"}}
