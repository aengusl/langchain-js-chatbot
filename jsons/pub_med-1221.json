{"pageContent": "The precise assessment of sexual dysfunction after treatment of prostatic cancer cannot be avoided in 2002. These iatrogenic complications may significantly alter the quality of life of the patients. In addition, sexual toxicity is progressively becoming a cardinal parameter for the treatment choice, both for the patient and the physician. Significant efforts allowed to reduce sexual toxicity after therapy in the recent years. As an example, nerve-sparing surgical techniques have been proposed, whenever reasonable. However, in spite of these surgical advances, data suggest that overall, the new irradiation techniques (conformal radiotherapy and brachytherapy) are responsible for less alteration of sexual life than surgery. Another potential advantage is that sildenafil (Viagra) is able to restore potency in a majority of cases after radiotherapy, while it is usually poorly effective after surgery.", "metaData": {"source": "The value of the marginalia as an adjunct to structured questionnaires: experiences of men after prostate cancer surgery\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16022075/"}}
