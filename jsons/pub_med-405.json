{"pageContent": "The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2019 \"Prostate cancer: diagnosis and management\" guidelines have recommended that all patients suspected of prostate cancer undergo multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) prior to biopsy. The Likert scoring system is advocated for mpMRI reporting based on multicentre studies that have demonstrated its effectiveness within the National Health Service (NHS). In recent years, there has been considerable drive towards standardised prostate reporting, which led to the development of \"Prostate Imaging-Reporting And Data System\" (PI-RADS). The PI-RADS system has been adopted by the majority of European countries and within the US. This paper reviews these systems indicating the similarities and specific differences that exist between PI-RADS and Likert assessment through a series of histologically proven clinical cases.", "metaData": {"source": "[Morphological changes in tumor and nontumor tissue in the treatment of prostate adenocarcinoma with high-intensity focused ultrasound in combination with androgen deprivation]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29927437/"}}
