{"pageContent": "Radiotherapy is the main salvage option after primary radical prostatectomy. Radical prostatectomy, cryosurgical ablation and high-intensity focused ultrasound are the main salvage options after primary radiotherapy. After primary radiotherapy, long-term oncological outcome of salvage radical prostatectomy and salvage cryosurgical ablation is fairly comparable with the results of primary radical prostatectomy and primary cryosurgical ablation. Side effects of salvage radical prostatectomy in elite centers are acceptable and side effects of salvage cryosurgical ablation in tertiary centers are almost the same as after primary cryosurgical ablation. Good long-term data after salvage high-intensity focused ultrasound are lacking and the risk of side effects is considerable. After primary radical prostatectomy, there is a high level of evidence for oncological benefit of salvage radiotherapy. Careful patient selection is important for all salvage modalities.", "metaData": {"source": "Focal therapy for localized prostate cancer in the era of routine multi-parametric MRI\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32051551/"}}
