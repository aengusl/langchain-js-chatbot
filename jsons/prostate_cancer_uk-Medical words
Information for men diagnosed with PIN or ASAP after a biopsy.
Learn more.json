There are two main types \u2013 choline PET and PSMA (prostate specific membrane antigen) PET. Booklet \u2013 Follow-up after prostate cancer treatment: What happens next?\nInflammation of the lining of the back passage. This can be caused by radiotherapy to the prostate and may lead to bleeding from the back passage, difficulty emptying the bowels, or a feeling of needing to empty the bowels but not being able to. It can start during or shortly after radiotherapy and usually settles down a few weeks after finishing treatment. For some men, side effects can last longer. Fact sheet \u2013 External beam radiotherapy.\nAn estimate of how prostate cancer will affect you, including whether it may affect how long you live (your life expectancy). It is sometimes called your outlook. No one can tell you exactly what your prognosis will be, as every cancer is different and will affect each man differently.

Chemicals are injected into the blood vessels that supply the prostate, blocking the blood supply and causing the prostate tissue to shrink. See also enlarged prostate.  \nThe prostate\u2019s main job is to help make semen \u2013 the fluid that carries sperm. It sits underneath the bladder and surrounds the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine (wee) out of the body.

It\u2019s a common condition that can affect men of any age, but it\u2019s most common in men aged between 30 and 50. Prostatitis can cause a wide range of symptoms, which vary from man to man. Common symptoms include aching in and around your testicles, back passage or the tip of your penis, pain in your lower abdomen (stomach area), groin or back, and urinary problems.

Booklet \u2013 If your prostate cancer comes back: A guide to treatment and support.\nSomeone who has had cancer is in remission when tests no longer show any signs of the cancer.\nWhere semen travels backwards into the bladder when you orgasm, rather than out through your penis. The semen is then passed out of the body when you next urinate. It isn\u2019t harmful and shouldn\u2019t affect your enjoyment of sex, but it may feel different to the orgasms you\u2019re used to. It can happen if you have radiotherapy to the prostate or an operation called a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). See also transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Booklet \u2013 Prostate cancer and your sex life.\nSee transurethral water vapour therapy.\nSomething that may make a person more likely to develop a disease.
