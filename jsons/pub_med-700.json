{"pageContent": "Objectives: Focal therapy with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an emerging option for the treatment of prostate cancer and often followed up by MRI. Image assessment of treatment failure, however, requires proper knowledge about typical procedure-related changes in prostate MRI, which is sparse, in particular for unilateral HIFU treatment and late follow up (beyond 6 months). The goal of this study was therefore to compile the type and frequency of such MRI findings in selected patients without recurrent cancer 12 months after prostate hemiablation.", "metaData": {"source": "Salvage robot-assisted radical prostatectomy following failed local treatments\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30945654/"}}
