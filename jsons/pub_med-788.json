{"pageContent": "Objectives: To assess the comparative safety and effectiveness of 2 prostate cancer treatment ablation modalities: irreversible electroporation (IRE) and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). METHODS: Two systematic literature reviews (SLRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) on IRE and HIFU were conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Searches were conducted in PubMed and EMBASE. Independent reviewers assessed literature eligibility and abstracted safety and effectiveness data. Oncological, safety, functional, and quality of life (QOL) outcomes were examined for each technology. MAs were conducted where data quality and availability allowed, using normal methods and a random/mixed effects model, and quality assessments performed.", "metaData": {"source": "Techniques and Outcomes of Salvage Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy (sRARP)\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32461073/"}}
