{"pageContent": "Recent advances in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) have started to change the therapeutic landscape allowing clinicians to choose from a broad range of treatment options. Understanding the mechanisms that transform prostate cancer (PCA) into a castration-resistant state has enabled investigators to explore critical pathways involved in such process allowing for rational therapeutic design. These novel therapies complement the modest success that chemotherapy has demonstrated in recent years. In this review, we discuss the different mechanisms that render PCA castration resistant and elaborate on the nonchemotherapy approaches evolving in CRPC. These include agents targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor, endothelin receptor antagonists, angiogenesis inhibitors, immunomodulatory agents, immunotherapy, novel antiandrogens, and delivery of cytotoxic agents via therapeutic antibodies. This timely review coincides with the identification of newer therapies in this setting affirming our steady movement towards better disease control.", "metaData": {"source": "Radiotherapy for high-risk prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25708578/"}}
