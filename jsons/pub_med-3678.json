{"pageContent": "The study included 164 prostate cancer patients with a history of acute or chronic urinary retention. Conservative therapy or transurethral resection of the prostate were carried out to all patients as treatment for urinary retention. There was studied an influence of transurethral resection of the prostate on the survival of patients with prostate cancer and development of radiation complications following radiotherapy. Overall survival of prostate cancer patients who underwent transurethral resection of the prostate was significantly higher than in patients who had only conservative therapy as a treatment of dysuria. The frequency of radiation complications was lower in patients who had transurethral resection of the prostate prior radiation therapy.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate Cancer Genetics: Variation by Race, Ethnicity, and Geography\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27986209/"}}
