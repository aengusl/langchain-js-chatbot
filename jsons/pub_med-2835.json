{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer continues to be the most commonly diagnosed cancer among Canadian men. The introduction of routine screening and advanced treatment options have allowed for a decrease in prostate cancer-related mortality, but outcomes following treatment continue to vary widely. In addition, the overtreatment of indolent prostate cancers causes unnecessary treatment toxicities and burdens health care systems. Accurate identification of patients who should undergo aggressive treatment, and those which should be managed more conservatively, needs to be implemented. More tumour and patient information is needed to stratify patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups to guide treatment options. This paper reviews the current literature on personalised prostate cancer management, including targeting tumour hypoxia, genomic and radiomic prognosticators, and radiobiological tumour targeting. A review of the current applications and future directions for the use of big data in radiation therapy is also presented. Prostate cancer management has a lot to gain from the implementation of personalised medicine into practice. Using specific tumour and patient characteristics to personalise prostate radiotherapy in the era of precision medicine will improve survival, decrease unnecessary toxicities, and minimise the heterogeneity of outcomes following treatment.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer elder alert.
