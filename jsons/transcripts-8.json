{"pageContent": " foreign I want to talk about things that men can do after they've had surgery and maybe they're having some side effects so first of all can we go over some of the side effects that someone can get from a radical surgery well this is a super important topic because if we had a non-toxic way to treat prostate cancer it wouldn't be such an issue prostate cancer itself is generally very curable the trouble is and in removing the prostate or and radiating the prostate men can end up with real problems in\n their quality of life after the treatment loss of sexual ability or capacity to get normal erections leaking urine and in the old days with bad radiation you could also have rectal problems I don't mean erectile problems I mean rectal problems where defecation is an issue so Stakes are really high in this whole discussion and oftentimes people are so frightened by the disease they don't really think about the repercussions of treatment they just want to rush to treatment but thankfully most prostate Cancers and\n practically all prostate cancers are very uh low grade and you do have time to think about what you want to do before you make these irreversible decisions but to address the question you're asking once people have had surgery then there are things you can do to improve the chances of getting normal erections back after the operation and this is a issue that often isn't talked about by the surgeons if I was a surgeon telling someone we're going to take your prostate out we're going to cure you there'll be a time\n afterwards when you won't be able to get erections but we're hopeful that at least half of you will get erections back over a period of 6 to 18 months you say okay that's a reasonable price to pay for for this getting rid of the cancer if the surgeons were truly honest they would say and if you want to maximize your ability to get normal erections you need to give an injection into your penis a couple times a week until the erections are happening spontaneously how many people would still pick surgery I mean it sounds\n Dreadful and I'm not highlighting this issue of of erection recovery with injections just to scare people it's really been shown in studies that people that will commit to doing that type of a process will have a much better chance of getting their erections back why is that when people go through surgery there's a shock that occurs to the nerves and Men stop getting erections for this 6 to 18 month period before the shock wears off and the erections start coming back but during that time the muscles that\n cause normal erections atrophy through the absence of nighttime erections that all men all healthy men get during the night and that exercise program God's exercise program to keep normal erectile function disappears and irreversible atrophy can set in this can be reversed by undergoing injection therapy with trimix or prostaglandins and this is all well understood in the impotence world but oftentimes not talked about especially with the ease now of giving Viagra and Cialis pills people just want to take a\n pill and the problem goes away pills don't work in the post-surgical shock period so it's very important for people who are about to undergo surgery to count the costs and say okay I'm going to do an operation but I have to commit to giving myself an injection in the penis twice a week after the surgery until things are restored and uh it sounds terrible giving an injection into such a sensitive area of the body but honestly when men learn how to do it it functions well and of course there are a lot of men that are doing\n this because they're permanently impotent and they get adequate satisfying erections that work so I don't want to try and intimidate people with the process but it is something I'd like men to consider before they consider surgery they're part of the program that men need to consider is a regular program of injection therapy to ensure that atrophy doesn't set in during the time the shock period after the operation so let's break this down a little bit how quickly after surgery are Men supposed to be\n injecting themselves I would suggest starting within a week or two of the operation men do not have to have intercourse they don't have to use these erections for any purpose sexual they simply need to ensure that the normal erectile process is being maintained so that they don't develop atrophy so you mentioned twice is that you know the minimum is that the what needs to happen the standard it has never really been worked out as the optimal frequency for doing erections after the operation but I would say at least once a week\n probably preferably twice a week I don't think this is a normal protocol that urologists are giving men are they prescribing p l injections after surgery or is this something a patient would need to advocate for themselves for I think they're going to have to advocate for themselves I think the urologists who are surgeons and want their patients to have surgery are a little intimidated by this Prospect of saying well if you do surgery now you have to do an injections in the penis I'm sure they rightly think that men are going to say\n no I'm going to do radiation I don't want to deal with this and so it doesn't come up and then it's very hypocritical to start mentioning it after the operation well by the way I didn't tell you that you need to now start injection therapy because I didn't want to frighten you before the surgery that you're going to have to do it but now I'm going to tell you this and of course they don't want to go there they don't want to admit that they really were not totally forthcoming with what is\n required when you do prostate surgery it doesn't come up so if patients don't advocate for themselves this is going to get swept under the rug and a lot of men that could have recovered normal erections if they'd been sensible enough to do these injections won't get the benefit of this type of program can you get these injections from your urologist or do you need to go to like a family doctor like if they don't want to talk to the urologist about it can they go to the family doctor or they need to have\n that conversation with their urologists urologists are really the ones that are trained in how this is properly done and I don't think that there'll be any pushback from the urologist if there's an energy and an impetus coming from the patient's side I think the urologists are just reticent to broach the topic because it's it's a rather distasteful thought that you're going to have to do this this program wow it's very effective it's understandable that urologists don't want to\n intimidate people with this Prospect they just want to cure the cancer and and be done with the whole Prospect so does one need to continue to take Cialis or Viagra while doing the injections through that entire process but certainly no harm in doing that and there is evidence that the pills do help to some degree but this whole diatribe of my part is is based on the fact that I believe men are maximally motivated to recover their normal sexual function and they're going to get much better and higher percentage likelihood of recovery\n if they pursue a program like I'm outlining so is there anything that a man can do before surgery to help prepare for that or have a better outcome well better outcomes are people who are fit eating the right diet not overweight it's like getting prepared for an event and of course continuing those things after the operation staying fit eating the right diet there is some sense that the exercise so-called Kegel exercises which build up the sphincter muscle May translate into better outcomes if you initiate that\n before surgery and then of course continue it after the surgery but the overall idea of your your embarking upon a big event when you have operations like this it's people want to minimize it but it's a big operation and the recovery is going to be better in healthy fit people than it is in people who don't pay attention to those things so how long does it typically take for a man to regain spontaneous erections without injections does it is it a you know a short-term process will you continue to have to do these injections\n throughout the rest of his life yes absolutely people do need to stay on the injections until they're getting spontaneous recovery of erections without injections that can be anywhere from two weeks to two years depending on the patient's age the quality of the operation their pre-existing functionality it's somewhat unpredictable and it really is just a commitment that men need to make if they're determined to try and get back to their Baseline oftentimes something that kind of gets confused is the\n difference between function like potency versus libido so obviously function is changing with the potency of being able to get a spontaneous erection after surgery but does libido change at all well in theory it shouldn't libido is driven more by testosterone men can be in theory interested in sexual activity even if they're unable to get an erection in practice however I've learned that that it for most men it's very intimidating to think about the prospect of sexual activity without the capacity to get an erection so impotence\n suppresses libido this is not Universal some couples learn how to have lots of fun without erections but when I first got into this field and I started talking to men I was rather surprised at how frequently the idea of sexual activity without a normal erection is quite distasteful for most men maybe as I've gotten older I can understand a little bit both sides of having a libido and not having a libido but the um the component of normal erectile function in men being excited and engaging in sexual activity is super\n super important and so many men will sign off on their their sex lives if they lose the ability to get erections so are these injections painful no they are not painful um although we have had men comment that getting an erection after an extended period without an erection can be uncomfortable sort of like stretching out an arm that you hadn't used for a long time but the the just a little tiny quote bee sting of a needle and men do not complain at all about it once they get over the you know the unpleasant\n thought of sticking needles in such sensitive areas of their body once men learn how to do it they become very comfortable with the process so today we talked about mitigating the side effects of surgery this is a really big topic but I think while we were filming this one of the things that came to mind is the fact that you need to be fearless and asking your doctor questions maybe you're uncomfortable with maybe you bring somebody who can ask those questions for you write your questions down ahead of time but whether\n it's penile injections or Cialis and Viagra or anything afterwards for care this is your life and your doctors are really busy sometimes they don't have all the time to like sit down and explain everything to you but if you're self-advocating you're going to have much better outcomes coming out of those medical visits and that is extremely important for aftercare so even if you're dealing with this now maybe you just had surgery and you're watching this video and you're wondering what to\n do call your doctor's office make those phone calls advocate for yourself talk to a nurse and get some answers and figure out the next steps for taking care of your specific needs I understand when it comes to men's sexuality that there is a lot we don't talk about but if you talk about it with your medical team which is absolutely a safe space you can get better outcomes for yourself and your family maybe your partners but even for your confidence it's very important if you need help
