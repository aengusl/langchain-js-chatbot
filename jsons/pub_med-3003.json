{"pageContent": "The outcome of conservative management in a consecutive series of 107 localized prostate cancers (mean age 73.5 years) has been analyzed. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 12 years. Following regular surveillance and no initial treatment, 3 died from prostate cancer with a median survival of 6.3 years compared to 34 who died from intercurrent disease with a median survival of only 2.6 years. The observed survival for the whole group was similar to the expected survival for an age-matched population in Scotland. This was despite the fact that the nodal status and the capsular invasion were unknown.", "metaData": {"source": "Challenges of managing elderly men with prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24821211/"}}
