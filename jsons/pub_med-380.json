{"pageContent": "Background: Partial ablation of the prostate using high-intensity focussed ultrasound (HIFU-PA) is a treatment option for localised prostate cancer. When local recurrence occurs, salvage robot-assisted radical prostatectomy is a treatment option for selected patients, but there is a paucity of data on the peri-operative safety, functional and oncologic outcomes of sRARP.. The objective of this study was therefore to describe peri-operative safety, functional and early oncologic outcomes following salvage robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (sRARP) for local recurrence after HIFU-PA.", "metaData": {"source": "Oncologic and Functional Outcomes of Partial Gland Ablation with High Intensity Focused Ultrasound for Localized Prostate Cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30036514/"}}
