{"pageContent": "The preservation of NANC nerve fibers (producing nitric oxide, NO) is necessary for erection recovery after retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP). Yet, it is impossible to establish when and if a patient will recover erections; therefore, we investigate the prognostic value of cavernous blood NO levels on this parameter. Nerve-sparing RRP was performed on 14 patients for localized prostate cancer. We evaluated all patients 3 months after surgery by IIEF score: no patients had erections. A cavernous blood sample was also taken to determine NO levels (as nitrite). Patients were evaluated again 18 months after surgery. In six cases, erectile function was compromised, whereas in seven cases, potency was restored. Statistical analysis showed a relationship between nitrite levels in cavernous blood 3 months after surgery and the recovery or erectile function at 18 months. We propose that cavernous NO blood levels are a prognostic index of erection recovery.", "metaData": {"source": "Psychological and functional effect of different primary treatments for prostate cancer: A comparative prospective analysis\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29706458/"}}
