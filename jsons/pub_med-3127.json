{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is the third most common cancer in Malaysia with the lifetime risk of 1 in 117 men. Here, we initiated a longitudinal Malaysia Prostate Cancer (M-CaP) Study to investigate the clinical and tumour characteristics, treatment patterns as well as disease outcomes of multi-ethnic Asian men at real-world setting. The M-CaP database consisted of 1839 new patients with prostate cancer diagnosed between 2016 and 2018 from nine public urology referral centres across Malaysia. Basic demographic and clinical parameters, tumour characteristics, primary treatment, follow-up and vital status data were retrieved prospectively from the hospital-based patients' case notes or electronic medical records. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS). The median age at diagnosis of M-CaP patients was 70 years (interquartile range, IQR 65-75). Majority of patients were Chinese (831, 45.2%), followed by Malays (704, 38.3%), Indians (124, 6.7%) and other races (181, 9.8%). The median follow-up for all patients was 23.5 months (IQR 15.9-33.6). Although 58.1% presented with late-stage cancer, we observed ethnic and geographic disparities in late-stage prostate cancer diagnosis. Curative radiotherapy and primary androgen deprivation therapy were the most common treatment for stage III and stage IV diseases, respectively. The median OS and bPFS of stage IV patients were 40.1 months and 19.2 months (95% CI 17.6-20.8), respectively. Late stage at presentation remains a challenge in multi-ethnic Asian men. Early detection is imperative to improve treatment outcome and survival of patients with prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Living with prostate cancer: randomised controlled trial of a multimodal supportive care intervention for men with prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21791109/"}}
