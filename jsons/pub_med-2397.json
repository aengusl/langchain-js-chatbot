{"pageContent": "Elimination kinetics of serum total and free prostate-specific antigen were studied for a ten days course after radical retropubic prostatectomy on 11 patients suffering from organ confined prostate cancer. Samples were taken before operation, immediately after finishing the operation and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 h after prostatectomy and then once a day for the following ten days. The measurements were performed with AxSym assays from Abbott Laboratories. The elimination of both total and free prostate-specific antigen followed a biphasic kinetics. In the fast phase, the average of the individual elimination half-lives of total and free prostate-specific antigen amounted to 6.3 h (SD = 6.1 h; range: 0.55 to 37.1 h) and 0.57 h (SD = 0.18 h; range: 0.22 to 0.89 h), respectively. In the slow phase, total prostate-specific antigen disappeared with an average half-life of 85.6 h (SD = 11 h; range: 47.2 to 261.7 h) and free prostate-specific antigen with an average half-life of 14.4 h (SD = 10.4 h; range: 2.4 to 30.3 h). These results might be significant for the use of free and total prostate-specific antigen and its ratio as a diagnostic and prognostic tool.", "metaData": {"source": "Living alone, obesity and smoking: important factors for quality of life after radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22793038/"}}
