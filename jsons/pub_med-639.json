{"pageContent": "Due to its slow progression and susceptibility to radical forms of treatment, low-grade PC is associated with high overall survival (OS). With the clinical progression of PC, the therapy is becoming more complex. The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) makes PC a difficult target for most immunotherapeutics. Its general immune resistance is established by e.g., immune evasion through Treg cells, synthesis of immunosuppressive mediators, and the defective expression of surface neoantigens. The success of sipuleucel-T in clinical trials initiated several other clinical studies that specifically target the immune escape of tumors and eliminate the immunosuppressive properties of the TME. In the settings of PC treatment, this can be commonly achieved with radiation therapy (RT). In addition, focal therapies usually applied for localized PC, such as high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy, cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and irreversible electroporation (IRE) were shown to boost the anti-cancer response. Nevertheless, the present guidelines restrict their application to the context of a clinical trial or a prospective cohort study. This review explains how RT and focal therapies enhance the immune response. We also provide data supporting the combination of RT and focal treatments with immune therapies.", "metaData": {"source": "Comparative Effectiveness Analyses of Salvage Prostatectomy and Salvage Radiotherapy Outcomes Following Focal or Whole-Gland Ablative Therapy (High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound, Cryotherapy or Electroporation) for Localised Prostate Cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34740477/"}}
