This study aimed to investigate whether receipt of specialized palliative care (SPC) is affected by typical female and male diagnoses (breast and prostate cancer), age, socioeconomic status (SES), comorbidities as measured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), or living arrangements (home vs nursing home residence). Furthermore, we wanted to investigate if receipt of SPC affects the place of death, or correlated with emergency department visits, or hospital admissions.", "metaData": {"source": "Non-invasive imaging of firefly luciferase reporter gene expression using bioluminescence imaging in human prostate cancer models\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17073822/"}}
