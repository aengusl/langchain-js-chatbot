{"pageContent": "Genes involved in cancer generation are usually tumor suppressors and oncogenes. Progressive genetic alterations in these genes are involved in the mechanisms of tumorigenesis. In prostate cancer, additionally several chromosomal loci that should harbor mutated genes have been proposed. Some genes have been found altered in prostate cancer, such as PTEN, TP53, AR, RNASEL (HPC1), ELAC2 (HPC2), CDKN2A and MSR1 and those can be natural targets for new strategies of treatment. Besides, gene therapy has been suggested to be suitable for prostate cancer treatment. This approach includes ex vivo corrective therapy, suicide, and antisense therapy.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer genomic signature offers prognostic value\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21088497/"}}
