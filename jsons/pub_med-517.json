{"pageContent": "Purpose of review: The index lesion theory has created a strong interest in partial gland ablation for men with prostate cancer. By only treating the focus of clinically significant disease and avoidance of surrounding periprostatic tissue, one may provide adequate oncologic control with minimal side effects. Accurate identification of the index lesion and effective ablation are critical for satisfactory oncologic outcomes. Herein, we review key ablative techniques used in partial gland ablation.", "metaData": {"source": "High-intensity focused ultrasound in prostate cancer: results after 3 years\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11062372/"}}
