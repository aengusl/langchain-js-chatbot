{"pageContent": "The identification of fusion genes provides new insights into the initial mechanisms of molecular events implicated in the prostate cancer tumorigenesis. The presence of TEMPRSS2-ETS fusion in up to half of all human prostate cancer makes it perhaps the most common genetic rearrangement in human epithelial tumors. Some data suggest that TMPRSS2-ERG fusion prostate cancers have a more aggressive phenotype, which may affect cancer progression and outcome in localized tumors treated with prostatectomy. This discovery should pave the way towards future targeted therapies.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer: primary ADT monotherapy not suitable for localized disease\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24861329/"}}
