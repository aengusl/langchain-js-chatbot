{"pageContent": "One hundred forty-six patients with clinically nonmetastatic carcinoma of the prostate were treated at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center from 1964 through 1976. Of these 146 patients, 24 (16.4%) had developed at least one additional primary cancer. This review contrasts the 122 patients who had a single primary prostate cancer only with the 24 patients who had additional primary carcinomas with respect to age, racial distribution, clinical stage, and prostate cancer histology including Gleason's score, patterns of failure of prostate cancer, and survival data. Local failure and distant failure were less in the multiple primary group. Patients with high Gleason's scores appear to be at greater risk for second primaries. Five-year observed survival (by actuarial life table method) for the single prostate primary group was 76.5%, and 5-year observed survival of the prostate multiple primary group where prostate cancer appeared first was 71%.", "metaData": {"source": "[Prostate cancer]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20414018/"}}
