{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is a significant cause of death among men of all races in the United States, and it does disproportionately affect Black men. This disease poses a number of questions that desperately need answers. These questions involve not just the cause and prevention of the prostate cancer, but a very real and valid question is \"does screening for and aggressive treatment of prostate cancer save lives.\" Almost all questions in prostate cancer are not questions unique to blacks or whites, or any specific population. These questions can only be answered through well-designed basic and clinical research studies. This research must be supported by both physician and patient participation. Conveying truthful, accurate information in this disease in which so much is unanswered is imperative. In American medical history, black men have often been misled or misinformed oftentimes by well-meaning paternalistic individuals. Physicians and laymen teaching about this disease must themselves realize and then truthfully convey \"what is known, what is not known, and what is believed.\" This will allow the layman to make educated decisions regarding screening, treatment, and participation in clinical studies.", "metaData": {"source": "The impact of supportive nursing care on the needs of men with prostate cancer: a study across seven European countries\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24064968/"}}
