{"pageContent": "Immunohistochemical and morphometric analysis of the microcirculatory bed in the tumor and non-tumor parenchyma of the prostate was carried out with the use of endothelial cell marker CD34 in patients treated by high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). The numerical density of microvessels in the adenocarcinoma focus did not correlate with the degree of its differentiation, while high values of this parameter were associated with lower incidence of local progression after HIFU. Effective HIFU ablation led to progressive fibrosis and significant reduction of the microcirculatory bed in zones of intact non-tumor glands in control samples; an inverse relationship between the degree of reduction of the microcirculatory bed and the probability of relapse was revealed. The use of HIFU in combination with androgen deprivation was associated with a decrease in numerical density of microvessels in zones of tumor and non-tumor parenchyma in patients with relapses.", "metaData": {"source": "Salvage of locally recurrent prostate cancer after definitive radiotherapy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22772432/"}}
