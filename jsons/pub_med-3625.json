{"pageContent": "Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) has a close relation with prostate cancer. It is involved not only in angiogenesis, cell proliferation/survival and glucose metabolism but also in p53, p21 and signal transduction pathway in prostate cancer. Further studies of HIF-1 may yield new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. We present a review of the structure and biological functions of HIF-1 and its relation with prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "[Long-term outcomes of prostate cancer patients treated with combined brachytherapy and maximal androgen blockade]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24418030/"}}
