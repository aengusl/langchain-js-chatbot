{"pageContent": "Purpose of review: The role of testosterone in the development of prostate cancer and the safety of testosterone therapy (TTh) after prostate cancer treatment, or in the setting of active surveillance, remains controversial. There are many concerns about using TTh in men, particularly those with a history of prostate cancer, ranging from a possible increased risk of cardiovascular disease to cancer progression or recurrence. With many prostate cancer patients living longer, and hypogonadism having significant morbidity, much care must go into the decision to treat. Here, we review the literature investigating the effects of testosterone on the prostate as well as the efficacy and safety of exogenous testosterone in men with a history of prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Safety and tolerability of intermittent androgen deprivation therapy: a literature review\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22435512/"}}
