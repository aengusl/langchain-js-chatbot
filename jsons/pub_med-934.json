{"pageContent": "Permanent prostate brachytherapy techniques are associated with excellent biochemical control for patients with localised prostate cancer. Ten-year data show that permanent prostate brachytherapy is compatible with external beam irradiation or radical prostatectomy. However, treatment protocols and techniques for prostate brachytherapy vary between centres and there is little conformity of treatment protocols. The selection of patients for monotherapy or combined external beam irradiation and brachytherapy is controversial. The role of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation also remains unanswered in patients with localised prostate cancer. In addition, post-implant dosimetry may in fact be more significant for predicting outcome than the addition of adjuvant therapies, and should be a requirement when performing prostate brachytherapy. Data now seem to support specific computed tomography (CT)-based criteria to evaluate implant quality and delivered dose to the prostate. Unfortunately, prostate oedema and poor imaging techniques are limiting factors for evaluating implant dosimetry. Treatment planning techniques that use new treatment planning computers may assist in improving the implant procedure and dosimetry and are now available.", "metaData": {"source": "Psychosocial perspectives on sexual recovery after prostate cancer treatment\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25753250/"}}
