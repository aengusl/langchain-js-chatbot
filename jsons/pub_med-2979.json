{"pageContent": "The problem of detecting localized prostate cancer following transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for benign prostatic hyperplasia is fairly common. Historically, radical prostatectomy (RP) after previously performed TURP was associated with poor surgical and functional outcomes. It is believed that the periprostatic fibrosis, scar tissue and inflammation after previous TURP may interfere with the optimal RP results. The present retrospective study evaluates intraoperative characteristics, postoperative oncological and functional outcomes of RP in patients with a history of TURP.", "metaData": {"source": "A core outcome set for localised prostate cancer effectiveness trials\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28346770/"}}
