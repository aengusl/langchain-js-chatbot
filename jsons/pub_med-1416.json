{"pageContent": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) is an important cause of reduced quality of life for men and their partners. Recent studies have found that cavernous nerve injury (CNI) during prostate cancer surgery and other pelvic surgery results in medically induced CNIED in more than 80% of patients. The efficacy of first- and second-line treatment options for ED is poor. A great deal of research has been devoted to exploring new methods of neuroprotection and nerve regeneration to save erectile function in patients with CNIED, especially in patients with cavernous nerve injury after prostate cancer surgery. In addition, such as neuromodulatory proteins, proimmune ligands, gene therapy, stem cell therapy, and the current cutting-edge low-energy shock wave therapy have shown advantages in basic research and limited clinical studies. In the context of today's modern medicine, these new therapeutic techniques are expected to be new tools in the treatment of cavernous nerve injury erectile dysfunction. This article presents the main causes, mechanisms, and treatment of cavernous nerve injury erectile dysfunction and combines them with new treatment strategies.", "metaData": {"source": "Utilization of pharmacotherapy for erectile dysfunction following treatment for prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20059662/"}}
