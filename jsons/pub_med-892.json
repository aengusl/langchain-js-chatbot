{"pageContent": "Background: The needs of gay men after prostate cancer treatment are becoming visible. This patient group reports a more negative impact of treatment than heterosexual men. Yet, gay men's experiences of post-treatment sexual changes are still little explored. This study aims to determine specific concerns of gay men's post-treatment sexual practices. Methods: A qualitative study design was deployed using semi-structured interviews as data. Participants were purposefully sampled through advertisements and the snowball method. Eleven self-identifying gay men aged 58-81 years and treated for prostate cancer participated in interviews during 2016-2017. The interviews were transcribed, coded and thematically analysed. Results: The analysis highlights sexual changes in relation to the physical body, identity and relations. Problematic physical changes included loss of ejaculate and erectile dysfunction. Some respondents reported continued pleasure from anal stimulation and were uncertain about the role of the prostate. These physical changes prompted reflections on age and (dis)ability. Relationship status also impacted perception of physical changes, with temporary sexual contacts demanding more of the men in terms of erection and ejaculations. Conclusions: Gay prostate cancer survivors' narratives about sexual changes circle around similar bodily changes as heterosexual men's, such as erectile problems and weaker orgasms. The loss of ejaculate was experienced as more debilitating for gay men. Men who had anal sex were concerned about penetration difficulties as well as sensations of anal stimulation. Additional studies are required to better understand the role of the prostate among a diversity of men, regardless of sexuality.", "metaData": {"source": "Salvage local therapy for radiation-recurrent prostate cancer - where are we?\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27729992/"}}
