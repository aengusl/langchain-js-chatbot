{"pageContent": "Oligometastatic prostate cancer (OMPC), generally defined by presence of five or fewer metastatic sites on imaging, represents a transitional state between localized and widespread metastatic disease and encompasses a wide spectrum of disease biologies and clinical behaviors. A collaborative effort is ongoing to determine the genomics of OMPC. The prevalence of OMPC varies significantly in the literature and is likely to change further as substantial improvements in imaging improve our ability to reclassify a subset of patients with biochemical recurrence by conventional imaging as OMPC and another subset from OMPC to polymetastatic disease. The mainstay of OMPC treatment remains systemic therapy, either with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) alone or in combination with other agents (docetaxel, abiraterone, etc.). Focal therapies, including resection or radiotherapy (RT), to the primary tumor have demonstrated an improvement in outcomes, including failure-free survival in several retrospective studies. RT to the prostate has specifically demonstrated an overall survival (OS) advantage in patients with low-volume disease in a clinical trial. Improvement in outcomes has been observed with focal therapies for retroperitoneal and more distant metastatic sites in retrospective studies. Advancements in our understanding of the biology, imaging modalities, and treatments may allow for aggressive multimodality therapies in an effort to obtain deeper responses and, potentially, cures for selected patients with OMPC with favorable clinicopathologic characteristics. Participation in clinical trials or institutional registries is strongly encouraged for patients with OMPC who opt for an aggressive multimodality approach.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer screening: contrasting trends\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25822574/"}}
