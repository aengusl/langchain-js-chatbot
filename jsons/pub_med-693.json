{"pageContent": "These last years, focal therapy is emerging as an intermediate management technique between radical approaches (radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation and brachytherapy) and active surveillance to manage some early stage prostate cancer. Different energy modalities are currently being developed. Prostatic tumour destruction can be achieved with different energies: freezing effect for cryotherapy, thermal effect using focalized ultrasound for HIFU and using thermal effect of light for FLA, and activation of a photosensitizer by light for PDT. Those techniques carry a low morbidity but clinical experience is limited regarding to oncologic outcome. Prospective clinical trials are needed to highlight the full potential of this promising treatment modality.", "metaData": {"source": "Resistive index of prostatic capsular arteries as a predictor of prostate cancer in patients undergoing initial prostate biopsy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25380843/"}}
