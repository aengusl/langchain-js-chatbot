{"pageContent": "Background: Despite intensive research over the last several decades on prostate cancer, many questions particularly those concerning early diagnosis and the choice of optimal treatment for each individual patient, still remain unanswered. The goal of treating patients with localized prostate cancer is a curative one and includes minimizing adverse effects to preserve an adequate quality of life. Better understanding on how the quality of life is affected depending on the treatment modality would assist patients in deciding which treatment to choose; furthermore, the development of prognostic biomarkers that indicate the future course of the illness is a promising approach with potential and the focus of much attention. These questions can be addressed in the context of a cohort study.", "metaData": {"source": "[Nuclear export signal of androgen receptor regulated of androgen receptor stability in prostate cancer]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28816267/"}}
