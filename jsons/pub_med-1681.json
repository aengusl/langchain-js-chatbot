{"pageContent": "Docetaxel is an anti-microtubular agent in the family of the taxanes, now FDA approved as first line chemotherapy for the treatment of hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer. Recent data from two large randomized Phase III trials showed a survival advantage in hormone refractory prostate cancer patients treated with docetaxel. This discovery changed the perceptions about utilization of chemotherapy for this devastating disease and introduced a new paradigm/standard of care treatment for this patient population. The management of elderly patients with metastatic prostate cancer is an important issue because according to data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, the American Cancer Society, and the United Nations, the incidence of prostate cancer in elderly men is expected to increase since people are living longer. In this paper we will review the results of trials evaluating docetaxel in hormone refractory prostate cancer and the implications of these trials as they relate to diagnosis and management of this disease in the elderly man.", "metaData": {"source": "Preserving potency after prostate cancer surgery\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12356553/"}}
