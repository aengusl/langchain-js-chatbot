{"pageContent": "Focal therapy (FT) represents a potential shift in clinical practice by featuring a tissue-sparing approach for prostate cancer (PCa) treatment. It stands midway between active surveillance (AS) and more aggressive options like radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiotherapy. The field has enormously evolved in the last few years but there are still pending questions to answer in the future. The manuscript overlooks FT in terms of indications, available energies, situation of tumor microenvironment, follow-up, re-interventions, and the future of this approach for PCa.", "metaData": {"source": "Transrectal high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation of prostate cancer: effective treatment requiring accurate imaging\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17689218/"}}
