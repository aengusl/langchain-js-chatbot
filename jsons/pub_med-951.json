{"pageContent": "Many published articles have documented the impact of prostate-cancer treatment on sexual functioning in men treated for localized disease. Surprisingly, the literature on interventions to rehabilitate men's sexual functioning is much more limited. In this article, we review the sexual-rehabilitation interventions for prostate-cancer patients and identify a number of common themes across interventions. We also identify areas where further research is needed and propose a conceptual model based on psychologic and nursing theories and informed by the published research.", "metaData": {"source": "The evaluation of sexual functions of prostate cancer patients receiving radiotherapy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34761623/"}}
