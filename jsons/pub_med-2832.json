{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common noncutaneous malignancy affecting American men and the second most common cause of cancer death. The traditional risk classification schemes for PCa are limited due to the vast clinical and molecular heterogeneity of the disease. Fortunately, recent advancements in sequencing technologies have provided us with valuable insight into the genomics of PCa. To date, a wide array of recurrent genomic alterations in PCa have been identified. Incorporating these distinct molecular subtypes of PCa into prediction models provides opportunities for improved risk stratification and ultimately better patient outcomes. In this review, we summarize the key molecular subtypes of PCa and focus on those genomic alterations that have clinical implications for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic response.", "metaData": {"source": "Examining the Racial Disparities in Prostate Cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34418408/"}}
