{"pageContent": "With five novel therapies shown to improve survival in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in the last 3 years, patients are now living longer and experiencing better quality of life. Since docetaxel became standard of care for men with symptomatic metastatic CRPC, three artificial treatment \"spaces\" have emerged for prostate cancer drug development: pre-docetaxel, docetaxel combinations, and following docetaxel. Multiple therapies are currently under development in both early and late stage CRPC. Additionally, the novel agents abiraterone, radium-223, cabazitaxel, and enzalutamide have all been approved in the post-docetaxel setting. Strategies for patient selection and treatment sequencing are therefore urgently required. In this comprehensive review, we will summarize the preclinical and clinical data available with regards to sequencing of the novel treatments for CRPC.", "metaData": {"source": "Preoperative erectile function is the only predictor of the use of a high number of phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors after bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24784890/"}}
