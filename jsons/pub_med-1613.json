{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is the most prevalent solid tumor malignancy and second-leading cause of death from cancer for American men. As a consequence of treatment-related side effects, men living with prostate cancer experience various obstacles to positive mental health. Unfortunately, relatively little is known about factors that promote or impede men's adjustment to these obstacles. In this article, the authors identify three masculine gender scripts that may contribute to men's adjustment following treatment for prostate cancer. To organize the discussion, the authors review related literature and, through case examples, illustrate how masculine gender scripts may influence men's adjustment. Directions for gender-sensitive interventions and future clinical research are provided.", "metaData": {"source": "[Sexual function after radical prostatectomy does not affect global patient satisfaction]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15751413/"}}
