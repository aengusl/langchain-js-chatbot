{"pageContent": "Aims The aim of this study was to assess the incidence, management and outcomes of incidentally diagnosed prostate cancer following TURP. Methods A retrospective review was performed using the histopathological departments\u2019 database of all patients who underwent a TURP across two university teaching hospitals over a ten year period. Results During the study period, a total of 826 patients underwent a TURP. 72 (10.3%) had an incidental diagnosis of CaP following TURP. 46 (63.9%) were managed expectantly while 26 (36.1%) underwent active treatment. Overall mortality was 29.2% (n=21) while cancer specific mortality was 6.9% (n=5). All these patients were in the hormonal treatment sub-group. Conclusion Our study demonstrates an expectant approach is favourable in low risk disease. Curative treatment does need to be considered for younger patients with a long life expectancy or patients with higher risk disease.", "metaData": {"source": "What is the correct staging and treatment strategy for locally advanced prostate cancer extending to the bladder?\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26150029/"}}
