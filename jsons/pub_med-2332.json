{"pageContent": "Little is known about the pathological features of radical prostatectomy among men living in the Middle East. Although prostate cancer became the most common malignancy among males in some countries in the Middle East, the incidence is much lower compared to western populations. The aim of this study is to analyze pathological features and biochemical recurrence in men who underwent robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) in Kuwait. The data on all RARP cases performed by a uro-oncologist (SA) were recorded. A comprehensive database was collected, including demographic, clinical, and pathological data. Between February 2014 and November 2019, 65 RARP cases were performed out of a total of 200 robotic urological procedures. The median follow-up was 41.5 months [inter quartile range (IQR) 27.6-52.7]. Eleven (17%) complications occurred in 7 patients, 64% were early (< 30 days post-operatively) and minor (Clavien I-II). Thirty-five (54%) patients had \u2265 pT3 disease. Overall, 12 (18%) patients had a positive surgical margin (PSM), and all had \u2265 pT3 disease. Potency and continence rates at 12 months were 82% and 97%, respectively. The mean and SD of the hospital stay were 2.7 \u00b1 1.1 days. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) rate was 10%. Men with prostatic adenocarcinoma treated with RARP in Kuwait show a high incidence of pT3 disease. PSM and BCR rates were similar to multiple reports in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first report of RARP pathological outcomes in the gulf cooperation council (GCC) region of the Middle East.", "metaData": {"source": "[Results and participation factors to the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) with Prostate Specific Antigen: French departments of Tarn and H\u00e9rault]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19559380/"}}
