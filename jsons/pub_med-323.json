{"pageContent": "MR-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (MRg HIFU) is a novel method of tissue ablation that incorporates high energy focused ultrasound for tissue heating and necrosis within an MR scanner that provides simultaneous stereotactic tissue targeting and thermometry. To date, MRg HIFU has been used primarily to treat uterine fibroids, but many additional applications in the pelvis are in development. This article reviews the basic technology of MRg HIFU, and the use of MRg HIFU to treat uterine fibroids, adenomyosis, and prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "[Current state of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) as treatment of prostatic carcinoma]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17896561/"}}
