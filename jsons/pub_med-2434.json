{"pageContent": "Background: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the leading systemic therapy for locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancers (PCa). While a majority of PCa patients initially respond to ADT, the durability of response is variable and most patients will eventually develop incurable castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Our research objective is to identify potential early driver genes responsible for CRPC development.", "metaData": {"source": "Stiffening of DU145 prostate cancer cells driven by actin filaments - microtubule crosstalk conferring resistance to microtubule-targeting drugs\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33885607/"}}
