{"pageContent": "Purpose: In daily clinical practice, it is challenging to accurately diagnose suspected neoplasias in the small pelvis by minimal invasive means, and CT-guided biopsy is often limited in its feasibility. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy can verify suspected neoplasias in the small pelvis histologically.", "metaData": {"source": "Deep pelvic postprostatectomy pseudoaneurysm treated by transrectal ultrasound-guided thrombin injection\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23737023/"}}
