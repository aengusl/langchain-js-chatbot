{"pageContent": "High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment has recently been pursued to reduce radical treatment-related morbidity in low-to-intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer (PCa), especially in older men. The aim of this study was to develop a dedicated framework for HIFU therapy. All clinical data, such as risk categories, magnetic resonance with functional parametric imaging, and histopathology, are essential for driving proper HIFU treatment. All needed data can be added to the framework to localize areas that need to be treated. Once PCa areas have been featured, quantified, and located, planning can be adapted to drive accurate HIFU treatment. Our planning framework may be useful for all ablative therapies in order to standardize treatment for both clinical and scientific purposes.", "metaData": {"source": "Morbidity of focal therapy in the treatment of localized prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23265382/"}}
