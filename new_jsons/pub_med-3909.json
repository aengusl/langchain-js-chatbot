{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the second most common cause of cancer-related death in men in the United States. Unfortunately, at the current time, no curative treatments are available for metastatic prostate cancer. As is the case for most solid tumors, the recruitment of blood vessels (angiogenesis) is key for the progression and metastasis of prostate cancer. Inhibition of this process is an attractive approach to treatment. Many antiangiogenic agents are currently in clinical development. The following discussion will outline the importance of angiogenesis in the metastasis and progression of prostate cancer, summarize the current surrogate markers of angiogenesis available for the drug development of antiangiogenic agents, and review examples of investigational agents that target tumor angiogenesis (e.g., TNP-470, Thalidomide, CC5013, Carboxyamido-triazole (CAI), Endostatin. SU5416, SU6668, Bevacizumab (Anti-VEGFrhuMAb), and 2-Methoxyestradiol).", "metaData": {"source": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging and molecular pathology at the crossroad of the management of early prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25944677/"}}
