{"pageContent": "The aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of a new spherically curved 1.5-D phased array for the treatment of localized prostatic cancer. The device is designed to conform to the Ablatherm machine (EDAP-Technomed, France), a commercially available machine in which high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment for prostate cancer is administered transrectally. It uses high intensity electronically focused ultrasound to steer a beam along two axes, allowing enough depth to be reached to treat large prostates and eliminating two degrees of mechanical movement. Through computer simulation, it was determined that a curved 1.5-D configuration offered the optimal design. Two configurations were then proposed, and their ability to steer a beam within a target volume centered on the geometric focus of the transducer was simulated. An eight-element prototype was constructed to test the piezo-composite material and its electro-acoustical efficiency. Then, an array was constructed, and a multi-channel amplifier and control system were added, to permit remote operation. Acoustical and electrical measurements were made to verify performance. Finally, the 1.5-D array was tested in vitro on samples of pig liver to confirm the ability to induce lesions.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer therapy with high-intensity focused ultrasound\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16425987/"}}
