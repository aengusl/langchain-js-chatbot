Many men fail to get medical attention when sick or in pain and often present at health services in a more advanced stage of disease.\u201dIndeed, mass media does little to alter this behaviour. Googling \u201cWomen\u2019s health\u201d generates top listings that focus on information about women\u2019s bodily functions and approaches to health and health prevention, typified by images like this:\n\n\n\nA google image search on \u201cMen\u2019s health\u201d delivers this :\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong or misleading about this image or the message it\u2019s conveying, but it is representative of a bias toward fitness \u2013 and competitive fitness \u2013 \u00a0versus overall health, something that the media perceives most men can comfortably talk about amongst their peers.But does it reflect what men want, or need, to know to improve or retain their health?In the flurry of new year media on health and wellbeing, the Times offered Seven Midlife Health Tips every man over 50 should know. Along with \u201close the paunch\u201d, \u201cwalk further and faster every day\u201d \u201cprotect against heart disease\u201d and \u201chave three consecutive alcohol-free days a week\u201d is \u201cprotect your prostate\u201d:\u201cAbout one in eight men in the UK will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime, according to the charity Prostate Cancer UK. The single biggest risk factor is age, but lifestyle habits play a part. \u201cBeing overweight, not exercising enough, drinking too much, being black and having a family history of the disease all increase a man\u2019s risk \u2026 If you have risk factors or any symptoms, such as changes in the way you urinate, you should consult your GP. All men over 50 are entitled to a free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test, and Prostate Cancer UK advises anyone with a higher risk to speak to their GP from the age of 45.\u201dWe applaud the Times for offering this advice and integrating prostate health with other aspects of men\u2019s health. Taking an interest in prostate health as part of overall health builds the confidence and knowledge necessary to make sound, informed choices and to effectively self-advocate if prostate cancer develops in future.Do you have views on how men\u2019s health is promoted or provided? We\u2019d love to hear from you.\u00a0Your email address will not be published.
