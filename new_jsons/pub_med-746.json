{"pageContent": "A multifunctional organic-inorganic hybrid nanocapsule based on Bi2S3-embedded poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanocapsule has been elaborately designed to combine the merits of both polymeric shell structure and Bi2S3 nanoparticles. Hydrophobic Bi2S3 nanoparticles were successfully introduced into the PLGA nanocapsules via a facile and efficient water/oil/water (W/O/W) emulsion strategy. The elastic polymeric PLGA shell provides the excellent capability of ultrasound contrast imaging to the Bi2S3/PLGA. Meanwhile, the potential of these microcapsules to enhance the high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy was demonstrated. Importantly, this research provided the first example of both in vitro and in vivo to demonstrate the radiosensitization effect of Bi2S3-embedded PLGA hybrid nanocapsules against prostate cancer under external X-ray irradiation. Thus, the successful integration of the Bi2S3 and PLGA nanocapsules provided an alternative strategy for the highly efficient ultrasound guided HIFU/RT synergistic therapy.", "metaData": {"source": "Transrectal focused ultrasound combined with transurethral resection of the prostate for the treatment of localized prostate cancer: feasibility study\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15126799/"}}
