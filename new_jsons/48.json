So, instead of irradiating or removing the whole gland, you just treat the part with the cancer \u2013 hopefully reducing the risk of side effects like incontinence and erection difficulties.Killing tumours with high intensity focussed ultrasound (HIFU) is one such technique that is currently being trialled at Southampton General Hospital. I went to see consultant urological surgeon Tim Dudderidge to learn more.DudderidgeThe prostate gland, I\u2019m holding a small model here which is probably about 50 cubic centimetres in size and this is a 3D rendered model of an MRI scan of someone\u2019s prostate.\u00a0 And you can see that the tumour in this particular case may be between one and two cubic centimetres and this is a fairly small tumour that one might consider suitable for HIFU treatment.PorterSo it\u2019s like a small pea in the middle of a plum.DudderidgeThat\u2019s right.\u00a0 So when I see people with these kind of findings, as I was doing this morning, you go through the different options and this is a means of treatment that involves heating up the prostate and that\u2019s done using this probe here, which produces ultrasound which is focused.\u00a0 And that heat energy is concentrated in a small area about the size of a grain of rice and that focal point will get to about 80 or 90 degrees Centigrade.\u00a0 Now obviously the prostate is bigger than a grain of rice and so when you\u2019re planning this treatment you have ultrasound images which you capture using the same device and you can plan on the screen where you want to treat.\u00a0 And so originally we were treating the whole of the prostate but we realised that actually this is a much better technology for just partially treating the prostate.\u00a0 And so you would plan out the areas based upon your understanding of where the cancer is, based upon the imaging, and that will enable you to ablate the tumour and the surrounding area and avoid important structures like the urethra or sphincter, the bladder and the neurovascular bundles.SprangerMy name\u2019s Howard Spranger, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer December 2014.\u00a0 For a couple of years before I\u2019d sort of had trouble going to the loo sometimes in the night.PorterGetting up for a pee.SprangerYeah, yeah and I did recall my father once having to have an ambulance to take him away because he had a similar problem.\u00a0 And I just thought it was a family trait.\u00a0 And \u2013 but I got it checked out eventually and it was kind of inconclusive.\u00a0 I suppose at the back of my mind there was always the possibility that it might be a cancer in the prostate.\u00a0 But you don\u2019t want to think that way and nothing led to it really at that time.DudderidgeHoward\u2019s PSA was rising and at that point we felt it was necessary to get an MRI scan.\u00a0 In his case the MRI scan showed an area on one side of the prostate which appeared to be abnormal.\u00a0 And at that time it was my practice to do mapping biopsies of these cases.\u00a0 And those biopsies really identified that the disease was only on one side, matching up with the imaging findings, and then that led us into a conversation about his options really between focal therapy or between having surgery or radiotherapy.SprangerThe surgery to remove the whole gland \u2013 it felt to me like overtreatment but that was just because all I knew was that the cancer was fairly localised.\u00a0 And it was a big thing to go into as well, the potential side effects \u2013 incontinence and impotence really was what it boiled down to, neither of which prospects were particularly appealing.\u00a0 And I\u2019d already been briefed on HIFU, I\u2019d been told about it.\u00a0 The fact that it was not surgical just appealed to me, I mean I\u2019ve a fairly technical background and it was something I thought yeah this is a good novel new way of doing something and the least worse option, if you like.DudderidgeNow as a general rule when we\u2019re treating the prostate what we\u2019re trying to do is trying to obtain lower side effects than you get with surgery, so this is the main advantage \u2013 you want to not have any incontinence, not have any erectile dysfunction.\u00a0 And so whilst we\u2019re treating half the gland you might treat one of the nerve bundles but we know that by completing untreating the other side most people will have normal erections afterwards.\u00a0 And so what we find is about quarter of people may need to use a Viagra or one of these drugs afterwards but only one in 20 probably don\u2019t have erections despite that.\u00a0PorterSo how do you actually operate \u2013 presumably the patient\u2019s lying on their back, this probe goes into the rectum, up their bottom effectively\u2026DudderidgeThat\u2019s right.PorterAnd then that gives you the pictures that you\u2019re looking at.DudderidgeSo we start off by bringing the patient into the operating theatre under an anaesthetic.\u00a0 We put the legs up so we can access the perineum and the probe goes into the back passage, it\u2019s got lots of lubricating jelly and that makes a good contact for the sound energy to travel through.\u00a0 We then take some images of the prostate and then we mark it out in three different areas typically \u2013 the front, the middle and the back \u2013 and these areas overlap so you don\u2019t get any gaps in the treatment.PorterBut the idea effectively is to leave as much healthy prostate tissue as possible and the surrounding structures, like the nerves, untreated?DudderidgeThat\u2019s correct.\u00a0 And so the degree to which you do that is something that\u2019s of interest to us because we might be able to bring it closer and closer to the lesion, the more and more confident we are that we know where the lesion is.PorterAnd how long does the procedure take?DudderidgeYou\u2019re talking about two hours in theatre.\u00a0 So we normally do four cases in a day.PorterOf course the big difference between this procedure and removing the gland completely is the cancerous tissue is potentially still inside the patient, you hoped to have killed it but do you know for sure?DudderidgeSo I\u2019m someone who does surgery and I do focal therapy and so I\u2019m often torn with this situation where somebody who on paper is somebody who could be a candidate for a trial.\u00a0 We have very rigid trial inclusion criteria.\u00a0 So I no longer have to worry about it myself, I have some rules and I follow the rules.\u00a0 And yet despite that there\u2019ll be a bit of me anxious about whether they should be having a complete removal of the prostate.\u00a0 And so you do live with this uncertainty.\u00a0 And the reason I\u2019m uncertain is because we don\u2019t know and we\u2019re running a trial and we\u2019re taking these patients where we don\u2019t know which is best for them and we\u2019re offering them the chance of randomisation.\u00a0 And I think this is the best way to answer this question and I really encourage all the patients to consider this.\u00a0 But let\u2019s say we\u2019ve treated someone with HIFU and we\u2019re monitoring them, they will require long term follow up, which may involve repeated imaging and biopsy and they may require repeated treatment if they\u2019re unfortunate enough to have a recurrence.\u00a0 We know from the data about one in five will need a retreatment and about one in 10 will need their prostate removing and patients have been told that beforehand, they\u2019ve signed up to that but for the majority of patients they will have one treatment episode which gets rid of their disease, leaves them with few side effects.\u00a0 A substantial number of patients will avoid major surgery who will have otherwise had it or radical radiotherapy and I think for those men who do avoid it successfully, which is the vast majority, this is a really important thing for them.PorterTim Dudderidge talking to me in Southampton.\u00a0Mark Emberton, you\u2019re also working on a new localised approach to treating tumours in the prostate and one that\u2019s been in the headlines recently.EmbertonYeah so you\u2019re describing focal treatment.\u00a0 It\u2019s interesting prostate\u2019s probably the last organ that exists where we typically treat at the whole gland level.\u00a0 When I was training as a urologist I was taught to remove the whole kidney if somebody had renal cancer, today we go to huge efforts to try and preserve as much kidney as possible.\u00a0 And obviously mammography has changed the way we manage breast cancer, that happened 40, 50 years ago.\u00a0 MRI is now identifying disease, we can see very, very tiny cancers that measure 0.2 ccs, that\u2019s about eight millimetres across and it\u2019s not beyond the wit of man then to direct energy at those cancers plus a little margin around them and by doing so treat the cancer and try and preserve function.PorterNow Southampton are using HIFU as we\u2019ve just heard, what are you using?EmbertonWe\u2019re using a range of treatments at present.\u00a0 The interest a couple of weeks ago related to vascular targeted phototherapy.\u00a0 This is a slightly complicated treatment in that we give a drug that sensitises the body to light and then we introduce light fibres into the prostate and that interaction between the light and the photosensitiser releases what we call free radicals which damage the cancer cells and actually stop the blood supply to those cells.PorterAnd this combination of photosensitising and laser light has been used elsewhere.EmbertonIt has been used actually, particularly successfully in difficult to treat areas, such as head and neck cancers where there are lots of key vital structures where typically surgery and radiotherapy result in damage \u2013 loss of voice, loss of being able to swallow.\u00a0 Photodynamic therapy or VTP is fascinating and offers a great opportunity to patients because it represents a new class of therapy, in other words a new way of treating prostate cancer.\u00a0 This is the first mature trial of photodynamic therapy that shows benefit over and above a control, which in this case was active surveillance.PorterNow HIFU\u2019s work in progress, your own work presumably is still very much work in progress, how long do you think it will be before we\u2019ll know for sure whether these treatments are safe to use in men?EmbertonWe know quite a lot about these treatments because HIFU, for instance, has been around for about 10 years now and there\u2019s quite a lot in the published literature.\u00a0 So we know about the safety, we know about the tolerability, so men having tissue preservation are very likely to be the same in functional terms \u2013 and by that I mean erections and incontinence \u2013 than they were before treatment.\u00a0 We also know what we call the early oncological outcomes, so in other words the cancer results at one and two years.\u00a0 What we don\u2019t yet know is what the outcome is going to be in 10 years because all new treatments we just have to wait for that long term data.PorterBut you see localised treatment as the way forward?EmbertonVery much so.\u00a0 I think our ability to risk stratify, so in other words to be very, very precise about the true cancer that that man has, puts us in a position now to offer a range of treatments that include surveillance, that include very radical surgery and radiotherapy for the very aggressive disease and then in the middle there\u2019s an opportunity for men to have their cancer treated but really diminish the side effects that have been typically associated with standard treatments.PorterProfessor Mark Emberton.\u00a0 And if you want to know more about that technique \u2013 and the HIFU being used in Southampton \u2013 then there are links on the Inside
