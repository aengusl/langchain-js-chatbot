{"pageContent": "Introduction: Newer approaches to the management of advanced prostate cancer have rapidly evolved. While basic androgen deprivation remains as the first line in newly diagnosed hormone na\u00efve metastatic prostate cancer, the agents used and strategies followed have undergone significant changes. Numerous new agents such as sipuleucel-T, abiraterone, enzalutamide, cabazitaxel and radium 223 have all been approved since 2010 to treat metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). New imaging techniques to detect advanced disease such as F-18 PET, 11 C-choline PET and other modalities are becoming available. The concepts of \"bone health\" and the management of side effects related to androgen deprivation therapy are also gaining attention as men are being treated with longer courses of androgen deprivation. Understanding the theory behind these new agents and management approaches while focusing on the practical clinical considerations are essential to improve outcomes in advanced prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Development of a diagnostic microarray assay to assess the risk of recurrence of prostate cancer based on PITX2 DNA methylation\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20304943/"}}
