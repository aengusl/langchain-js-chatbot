{"pageContent": "The intermediate and long-term results of primary full-gland cryoablation for localized prostate cancer with moderate- and high-risk patients suggests a cancer control rate similar to what can be achieved with radiotherapy and surgery, with an acceptable rate of complications. A recent shift in the treatment paradigm toward unilateral cryoablation (hemiablation) or ablation of unifocal lesion(s) in select patients suggests the ability of this approach to maintain a quality of life closer to the pretreatment level. However, trials with longer oncologic follow-up are needed. The development of more accurate imaging-based techniques-ie, image-guided prostate biopsy sampling and image-guided prostate cryoablation-is of paramount importance to selecting appropriate candidates for an organ-sparing procedure. To make this approach scientifically sound, further investigation to establish patient selection criteria, the development of molecular and imaging parameters of cryoablative efficacy, and regular careful follow-up of these patients is needed.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer: emerging concepts.
