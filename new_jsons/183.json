Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer amongst men in the UK and with this sombre fact comes a multitude of challenges and opportunities. I\u2019m Clare Delmar. Joining me today is Oliver Kemp, CEO of Prostate Cancer Research in the UK and director of PCR Inc. in the USA, whose missions Oliver describes as to use our deep understanding of patient priorities and the research ecosystem to enable and implement the innovations that have greatest potential for impact and to help scientists forge the connections and collaborations which will keep their work at the cutting edge. As to how his organisation is impacting the experience of patients and clinicians, Oliver said, \u201cIn the last five years, we\u2019ve quintupled the amount of research that we fund. We\u2019ve combined this diversification of research with a focus on ensuring that promising research reaches patients through our Translational Research division, which is called Proven Connect. In addition, we run patient outreach work which aims to spread the benefits of research to everyone. We\u2019ll continue to increase the quality and quantity of our work until hundreds of thousands of men can live without fear of prostate cancer.\u201d Oliver, thank you so much for joining today. I\u2019m very excited to hear more about what you\u2019re doing at Prostate Cancer Research.Thank you very much, Clare. Nice to be here.So that\u2019s quite a lot that I\u2019ve just described to our listeners. Quite an agenda. Let\u2019s start by maybe asking you to focus a bit on what you see as the most urgent needs in prostate cancer research right now.Yeah, there\u2019s a long list. How long have you got?Well, maybe the top three, if that would suit.Sure. I suppose a replacement for the PSA test. I think, as many of your listeners will be aware, it\u2019s got its faults. It\u2019s been a useful part of the diagnostic landscape for men with prostate cancer for a long time. But its faults are that one in seven of those people with normal PSA levels may have prostate cancer. So thousands of cases are missed if it\u2019s used on its own. And obviously that has life threatening consequences. As you mentioned in your introduction the parity of care, the rates of men diagnosed with metastatic disease have rocketed by 25% as a result of COVID. In some parts of the UK, the situation is dire. The increase in North Tees has been 52% and there\u2019s been a three fold increase in the number of men who are still awaiting results. Obviously, you\u2019re far less likely to survive if you\u2019re diagnosed late. You have a 99% chance of survival if you\u2019re diagnosed early, and that reduces to one in three, slightly less than one in three if you\u2019re diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer. So early diagnosis is crucial. If you ask for three, approval of precision medicines. We\u2019ve got two medicines that have been rejected by NICE in the last twelve months \u2013 Olaparib and Pluvicto, both of which extend life and extend the quality of life instead of being on chemotherapy, than obviously being on drugs that don\u2019t have such vicious side effects would be far more preferable. Cost implications obviously come into the reckoning, but we\u2019re here to advocate for the needs of men.Okay. Yeah, well, that\u2019s quite a spread, actually. And obviously the PSA test is quite topical at the moment, given that we know the arguments before and against. But what we also know is that the sort of ecosystem has changed as well with the advancement of imaging and more precision biopsies. Do you think that will impact how PSA is used, or are you committed to, as you said earlier, finding an alternative to that specific test?Yeah, and I think if we can find an alternative that has specificity and sensitivity, then I think it will gradually be replaced. So I do think that if it\u2019s used in combination with other diagnostic tools, then it can remain part of the overall framework. But obviously the long term aim would be to not have the issues that exist with the PSA test and replace it with something that\u2019s far better.Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s interesting to consider that because we could talk about this all day, if not all week. But what is interesting is to consider what you just said in the context of your second point earlier, which was the parity issue, and you cited the differential in men in the north of England and the higher level of those that have metastatic disease and or are waiting in fact, for diagnosis. I think that those statistics are quite stark. But what is interesting is with a test that is sort of universal, because even if you do have the advanced diagnostics and precision biopsies that I refer to, that make the PSA test possibly more, maybe I should say less onerous or less harmful. If you don\u2019t have those, and this goes back to the parity issue, then it\u2019s kind of a non starter, isn\u2019t it? So in which case, your point about a new test is probably a good way to go.Yeah, and I think I was just talking about it yesterday, in fact, the kind of rolling out MRI machines across the UK would cost billions of pounds and billions of pounds that we don\u2019t have right now. So you got to work with what you\u2019ve got. And if you compare\u2026 when we compare the list of what men would be offered in Blackpool compared to what they\u2019re offered in South Cambridgeshire. It\u2019s a very short list in Blackpool. So your point is exactly right. Sure, that\u2019s all well and good when you can go for an MRI scan five days later after doing a PSA, but if you\u2019re going to wait several months for that, that\u2019s not acceptable.Yeah. No, I understand. Well, let\u2019s just talk a little bit more about your organisation itself. Can you tell me what some of your greatest successes have been in recent years, say, the last five years?Yeah, definitely. You already mentioned that we\u2019ve expanded our research, actually five times now. We were running just four research projects in late 2017. We\u2019re now running 23 research projects, so we\u2019ve expanded the amount of research we\u2019re doing, but I think we\u2019ve also expanded the quality of the research that we\u2019re able to do. And that\u2019s mainly been because we\u2019ve added in a much broader network of advisors, peer reviewers, patients to help us make sure that we\u2019re finding the things that have got the potential to really move the needle for men and broaden that patient perspective so that we\u2019re able to ensure that we\u2019re doing things that will make a difference to people\u2019s lives in the long run.Can you describe some of the projects that you\u2019re currently supporting? You said 23. That\u2019s a lot. Can you give us an example of some of those that you think are most promising?Yeah, I think you will obviously be aware that prostate cancer can take many different forms and you can have some slow growing cancers that you may not want to do anything about for a while, and you can have some very virulent cancers that you may want to do something about very quickly. So we\u2019re funding an AI project out of University of East Anglia in combination with Manchester and Oxford, trying to subdivide the cancers into tigers and pussycats. So which ones are likely to kill you and which ones aren\u2019t, then that will obviously help clinicians further on down the line, being able to say, well, actually, your cancer has this particular genetic subtype. When we\u2019ve analysed all of these cancers in the past, it is likely to grow or it is likely to stay very small for a very long period of time. And you shouldn\u2019t go through incontinence and impotence for the rest of your life taking out a cancer that\u2019s not going to do you any harm.Yeah. So that phrase tigers and pussycats seems to apply to a number of cancers. Do you think it\u2019s a particularly apropos for prostate cancer or just in the nature of these extremes?Yeah, definitely, I think I\u2019m sure many of your listeners will be aware that prostate cancer can be a very slow growing cancer and so sometimes you can have prostate cancer and not increase in size over a decade. So, yeah, particularly for prostate cancer, that\u2019s important.And you mentioned that a good part of your research involves patients themselves. How do patients, or indeed former patients, get involved in your research?Yeah, in all sorts of ways \u2013 setting the strategy right through to the priorities of the research. They are an important part of the scientific advisory committee, they join the scientific advisory committee in order to help make decisions. They give feedback, actually, to the researchers. So the researchers submit proposals, we analyse them to try and select the ones that are most in line with our strategy and have the most potential for impact. And the patients actually sit round and give direct feedback to the researchers themselves to say, actually, this particular thing would make such a difference to our quality of life, or to allow the researchers to go back and think again about which ways in which they could improve their proposal before they come back to us.So how do the patients find out about you? How do you actually make that connection? Do you do outreach? How would a patient who\u2019s listening to this say, wow, I\u2019d really like to get involved with Prostate Cancer Research\u2019s initiatives? What would they do?Yeah, I mean, lots of patients\u2026 Already we do significant amounts of outreach work. We get involved with healthcare professionals, British Association of Urology Nurses. We obviously have our own outreach campaigns, so events and community driven activities. We work in partnerships. But if a patient wants to get in contact with us, info@pcr.org.uk \u2013 tell us that you\u2019d like to be involved in our research and our research team would love to hear from you.And most of the research that you fund and oversee is done at various universities or other institutions across the country.Yeah, and we try and make sure that we don\u2019t see the bright lights of Oxford and Cambridge in London and think, okay, well, that\u2019s where we should put our money. We try and make sure we assess the science for what it is and the applications that come to us. So we have research in Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and across the UK. So it\u2019s a really nice, broad focus of early stage, late stage career researchers with a whole range of different ideas dotted right across the United Kingdom.That\u2019s exciting. What sort of breakthroughs do you foresee from these applications? I mean, it\u2019s quite exciting to be able to assess all these different applications that are coming in. And has that led to some real excitement about potential breakthroughs?Yeah, definitely. And when you see the applications and they put something to you that you\u2019ve never seen before, I think that\u2019s the most interesting thing. If you look at the history of cancer, it\u2019s kind of breakthroughs that no one expects, that really are interesting. And the scientific advisory committee kind of sits down, everyone says, wow, this is something we hadn\u2019t expected, then that\u2019s really exciting. So, for example, we\u2019ve got a project that we\u2019re funding up in Newcastle, which looks at the sugars that cement themselves around cancers and how much that has an impact on whether a cancer cancer becomes aggressive or not. So kind of a bit, kind of left field kind of ideas that come to you. AI diagnostic machines that analyse results, find drugs that have kept people\u2019s cancers at bay, discover what environmental factors lead to cancers. I think the ability of AI to now analyse such larger chunks of data was never possible in the past. It opens up a whole range of different opportunities and the more personalised medicines as well. We\u2019ve already spoken about Olaparib and Pluvicto, making sure that the new treatments that are coming to us have less side effects on people, because I think we see so much treatment regret, where people have said, I\u2019m really upset that I made this particular choice and I wish I had another one.Yeah, there was a study just published in the last couple of weeks about that. You may have seen that in one of the major urological medical journals and it was based on a very wide reaching survey. So, yes, I completely agree with you. That does sound really interesting. I mean, you\u2019ve mentioned AI a couple of different times during this conversation. Is this kind of across the board or do you see it focused in particular area? Back to the large data sets that it gives us the opportunity to look at? What are you seeing that AI is going to help in the short term?Yeah, and I think we see a lot of proposals around the need within the NHS, where obviously there are huge pressures and not enough people to analyse the things coming out of diagnostic machines. So we see a lot of proposals around that type of thing because we know that we don\u2019t have the right amount of staff within the NHS and therefore a lot of the delays are coming from just not having the people. So if you could get an AI machine that\u2019s quicker, cheaper, more effective than a human being, then we should be able to save a lot of lives from it. So, yeah, we see plenty of proposals around that kind of work.So, I mean, just to bring this to an end, what messages would you like to give to men that are newly diagnosed with prostate cancer?I think one of the interesting things is that when you sit down\u2026 We do an event every year where we sit down with researchers and with men with prostate cancer \u2013 patients, and they always come out of it really enthused and so do the researchers and the patients themselves say, \u201cit\u2019s amazing. There\u2019s just this whole army of people out there trying to improve your life and quality of life.\u201d I think that\u2019s the message I\u2019d like to give to people. There are a lot of people out there trying to do incredible things in order to improve people\u2019s lives. So please be aware that there\u2019s a big support network out there that you should try and get engaged with.Well, thank you for that, that\u2019s very positive and I\u2019m sure our listeners will welcome it. And I will put the notes about your organisation on our website so people can follow up. I really want to thank you for speaking with me today, Oliver. It\u2019s been really helpful.
