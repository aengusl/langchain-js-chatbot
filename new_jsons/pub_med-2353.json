{"pageContent": "Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy, in terms of overall survival, of sequential systemic therapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (MCRPC) who lived in Nordland County, Norway, a large region with a challenging geography, yet only one department of oncology located in the main city, Bod\u00f8.Patients and methods: Overall 77 patients who had received at least 2 lines of treatment were included in this retrospective study.Results: Management included docetaxel in 69 patients (90%), often prescribed in first line. Only 12 patients (16%) started their treatment with a sequence of two endocrine drugs (enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate). Thirty-two patients (42%) were not eligible for treatment beyond second line, while 31 (40%) received 3 lines, and 14 (18%) more than 3 lines (for example cabazitaxel or Ra-223). Distance to the department of oncology did not predict for treatment with more than 2 lines. Only two factors were statistically significant: age <75 years and not initiating treatment with two lines of endocrine drugs. Survival increased with increasing number of lines of treatment. None of the five individual drugs available to these patients was significantly associated with survival.Conclusions: There was no indication toward under-treatment with systemic therapy among patients from the distant regions. Sequential treatment was feasible and survival increased with each additional line.", "metaData": {"source": "A decision aid for men with early stage prostate cancer: theoretical basis and a test by surrogate patients\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11703496/"}}
