{"pageContent": "Male sexual dysfunction, a common sequela following primary prostate cancer (PC) treatment, is likely to be more significant following salvage PC therapy. In general, these impairments in sexual domains can be divided into three groups, namely (1) sexual desire, sexuality and masculinity; (2) erectile function (EF); and (3) ejaculation and orgasm. However, there is considerable overlap between these sexual domains and male sexual response cycle, and various factors such as cancer status, mental well-being, medical conditions and social circumstances can adversely impact on the male sexual function. While several preventive and treatment strategies for the preservation and recovery of sexual function are available, there is limited consensus guidelines exist regarding the optimal rehabilitation or treatment protocol for men with sexual dysfunction following salvage therapy. While penile rehabilitation may be effective to restore erectile function and the ability to have coital sex, there is lack of effective treatments in other domains of male sexual function, thereby underscoring the importance of psychological and sexual counselling in sexual rehabilitation. Indeed, a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach is necessary to better understand and optimally assist and manage the men and their respective partners for better sexual health and activity.", "metaData": {"source": "Trans rectal ultra sound guided prostate biopsies: a single centre experience in Sri Lanka\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19391448/"}}
