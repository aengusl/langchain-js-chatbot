{"pageContent": "To date, there are no studies conclusively documenting that one treatment for localized prostate cancer is superior to another in terms of overall survival. Therefore, patients must consider other outcomes when choosing primary therapy for localized disease. One of the most important factors patients consider when choosing their treatment is the effect of therapy on their quality of life (QOL). Over the past decade, there have been an increasing number of studies assessing health related QOL (HRQOL) outcomes in localized prostate cancer. The goal of this article is to review our current understanding of HRQOL in this disease. We will begin by examining the established HRQOL instruments for use in localized prostate cancer. We will then discuss the effect of various treatments on QOL and review the literature comparing HRQOL outcomes between therapies.", "metaData": {"source": "Translational bioinformatics for diagnostic and prognostic prediction of prostate cancer in the next-generation sequencing era\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23957008/"}}
