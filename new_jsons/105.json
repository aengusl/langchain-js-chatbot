{"pageContent": "Consultant Urologist Alan Doherty from the Birmingham Prostate Centre discusses the advances in imaging and radiology that now make focal therapy a preferable treatment to Active Surveillance.Press play in the audio player below to hear the interview.Hello and welcome to The Focal Therapy Clinic. My name is Clare Delmar. And in this audio series, I\u2019m going to introduce you to some issues facing men diagnosed with prostate cancer that are little known, less understood and almost never talked about.Earlier this year, prostate cancer was acknowledged as the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the UK. And with this sombre fact comes a multitude of challenges and opportunities. In the fourth of our series, I\u2019m speaking with Alan Doherty, one of the UK\u2019s most renowned prostate cancer specialists and clinical director at the Birmingham Prostate Clinic. Alan has completed one of the largest case loads of prostatectomies in the UK, undertaking more than 3000 operations. He\u2019s recognised for his expertise in nerve sparing techniques, reducing the risk of erectile dysfunction and incontinence from prostate cancer surgery, and has published extensive results from his nerve sparing procedures. Recently, he was voted one of the UK\u2019s top ten prostate cancer specialists in a national poll of consultant urologists published in The Daily Mail. Alan, thanks for joining me.Hi, Clare.Wonderful to have you on our audio series. I\u2019m going to dive right in with a little bit of irony, I mean, having just described you as a leader and innovator in radical prostatectomies and other so-called invasive procedures, it\u2019s kind of amusing that I\u2019ve asked you to chat with me today about non-invasive procedures like focal therapy and active surveillance. So can you tell me how you came to embrace focal therapy into the treatments that you offer your patients?Well, it\u2019s a really good question. Good point. I think prostate cancer has such a multitude of different pathways and patients differ in how they value various outcomes. And it\u2019s not for me as a clinician to just offer one form of treatment, it\u2019s for me to offer a range of treatments which will be appropriate to the patient and their problem. So it would seem wrong to me to just be a specialist in one thing. And I think focal therapies have some advantages, but also some disadvantages.And why has focal therapy in your practice become more popular? If I could use that word, but do correct me if that\u2019s not the right word.I think it\u2019s because focal therapies, particularly HIFU, which stands for high intensity focused ultrasound is evolving and we are getting a better understanding of how it works and how we can deliver it and the benefits and the risks involved. So my patients are now able to perhaps understand what the advantages and limitations are a bit better. I mean, I have been doing HIFU for well, gosh, must be seven or eight years that we\u2019ve been I\u2019ve been involved in HIFU.I think the treatment was offered to perhaps too broad a spectrum of people. It was before the day of MRI scanning and we can now perhaps better identify where the cancer is. And we used to treat the whole gland. And I think the disadvantage of that was that it did actually cause quite a few problems. So the early use of HIFU was perhaps not quite as good as we seem to have it now. So my enthusiasm has increased as we\u2019ve got better understanding of it.So better imaging has clearly led to better diagnostics. And we can now see where prostate cancer lesions are and even measure how aggressive they are. Is that correct?Well, I think that is absolutely right. And I think the people who are enthusiasts of focal therapy do put a lot of value on the MRI scan. Of course, it\u2019s going to be a good MRI scan and there are various levels of quality to an MRI scan. They assume that the machine is the machine and the answer is the answer.I think a really high quality MRI scan where you can identify the higher grade cancer does open up this whole chapter of focal therapy to allow you to pinpoint destruction of the cancer and yet not causing a lot of collateral damage, which is what essentially gives the side effects to most treatments.So as well as opening up for for focal therapy it, the better the MRI, the better we can see this cancer. It also opens up opportunities for active surveillance. Does that mean now that it\u2019s a real option for some men and that we can literally watch them or surveil them, as the term suggests, regularly and closely?Well, that\u2019s very true. And yet you can also argue that if you have a treatment such as HIFU with very little co-morbidity, then why just watch the cancer go from a situation where it\u2019s not particularly dangerous to one where it is dangerous, when you could alter the natural history and at worst delay the progression or at best cure them? And I think people forget with active surveillance the monitoring does involve quite a lot of\u2026 the reasons it is called active surveillance because it is an active process.You have regular PSA blood tests, which of course can be stressful if the PSA is going up. You have numerous MRI scans which can be expensive and then sometimes you need repeat biopsies and so there is a strong argument that, you know, instead of putting people on active surveillance, well, you should consider treating the abnormal area. I think if the MRI scan picks up an abnormality. You think, well, why not treat that abnormality?I can see why, if the treatments available are potentially going to make your life miserable, that you might want to just monitor it. But if the treatments don\u2019t do that, then, you know, why not have it treated?We often find that patients come to us who are on active surveillance and it kind of comes to them a bit late in the game that the active, as you suggest this is on their part as well as the clinician.Well, I think people forget with active surveillance that, you know, what are we waiting for? Are we waiting for it to go from a curable to an incurable cancer? People think that we have this amazing ability to know when that\u2019s gonna happen. We don\u2019t. It\u2019s a probabilities game.You go from a very high likelihood of being cured to a lower probability of being cured. The question is, what percentage are you comfortable with? Are you comfortable with a 90 percent chance of being cured? Are you comfortable with a 70 percent?So in other words, the higher the PSA goes, the lower the likelihood of you being cured is. So it\u2019s all very well and good being monitored, but you have to understand the consequences of the monitoring. And the fact that it isn\u2019t quite as scientific as you might think \u2013 this is very much looking at a window of curability, which is closing the longer you monitor it for. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean that you necessarily will die of prostate cancer if you missed the window of cure, because we can control cancers very well with hormone treatments, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and lots of new treatments that are coming out.So, you know, when people see you\u2019re not going to die of prostate cancer if you go on to active surveillance. That\u2019s probably true. But you may end up having lifelong treatments, which had you gone for a curative treatment, that wouldn\u2019t be the case.Yeah. That\u2019s interesting. So while you have this technology to spy literally on the cancer. There\u2019s a lot of activity and other options that needs to be considered. Some people often have told us, too, that one of the challenges they face under active surveillance are more behavioural or psychological. Can you comment on that?Oh, yes, very much so. I think the average time people can stomach active surveillance is about two years.Have there been studies on that, or is that your observation?Observation, but also from studies, so if you look at studies like the ProtecT trial it\u2019s within the first two years that you tend to get that change. It\u2019s around two years where people just seem to have had enough of it and they say, well, fair enough, let\u2019s have treatment. So it\u2019s I suppose it\u2019s more observational than anything else.But certainly in the studies I\u2019ve been involved with, I\u2019m not surprised seeing patients at about two years saying enough\u2019s enough, the PSA has gone up and it\u2019s got into my head. PSAs tend to fluctuate up and down. And so, you know, sometimes people get sort of relief that the PSA has gone down a bit or was stable.But if the PSA doesn\u2019t and it\u2019s sort of slowly climbing up, which it tends to do over a two year period, you know, people just sort of say enough\u2019s enough, let\u2019s have treatment.So, like, let\u2019s just assume this two year period is an average of sorts. Would you say that there is a risk if you wait two years that, you know, the curative treatment that you mentioned might have to be more invasive? Is that something to warn someone on?Yeah, not only more invasive, but also more prolonged in that you\u2019ve missed the opportunity to go for a curative intervention and instead you\u2019re getting a sort of controlling intervention. And of course, we\u2019ve never come across a cancer ever that\u2019s gone away. And it tends to grow slowly.And the question is, what\u2019s the speed of progression? And nobody knows that for sure. So every now and then, you\u2019re going to have someone who you thought was going to progress slowly, who progresses more aggressively. And that\u2019s where this window of curability starts to close in terms of percentage likelihood of cure.So you will suggest to patients that focal therapy is a real alternative for active surveillance?That\u2019s very much my philosophy, which is if you are prepared to monitor it, then, you know, why wouldn\u2019t you want to go for a treatment that could potentially cure you? Almost certainly will delay the progression of it in that if you kill the majority of it, that\u2019s surely going to be helpful.And do most of your patients agree with that and take that action?Most of my patients will sort of get that. There are patients who worry about HIFU, partly because it\u2019s not\u00a0 available widespread. And I think, as I mentioned at the beginning, when it was used probably incorrectly and in too widespread a fashion, it\u2019s made some people wary.Certainly other urologists are a little bit wary of it and I think patients pick up on that. But I think the tide\u2019s changed. I think because of better imaging, as we said at the beginning, HIFU is going to become a bigger player.So a slight shift from this, but picking up on this whole idea of having to wait. And you know that the psychological and the clinical aspects of that. How are the delays in the diagnostics and treatment for prostate cancer based on Covid-19 in the last few months, how have those delays impacted your practice and your patients\u2019 treatment?I think there are patients who were halfway along the diagnostic pathway and it all suddenly came to an end. And in that group, you know, I\u2019ve seen patients who really got quite stressed by it because they didn\u2019t get to the stage where we were able to tell them whether this was an aggressive tumour or not or if they did have an MRI scan and it suggested that it was aggressive, they weren\u2019t able to go and have the biopsies to confirm it. So I think what\u2019s interesting is that a lot of patients won\u2019t have had their PSA blood test.Now, as you know, PSA is the way that we assess the risk of having prostate cancer. It\u2019s a prostate health check in a way. And the charities that used to do the PSA measurements, the GPs that would have done it as part of the sort of symptoms assessment. And then there\u2019s the BUPA health checks, the health assessments. They haven\u2019t been done. So there are probably people who just don\u2019t even know they\u2019ve got a high PSA who will no doubt be found in the next few months or so. And I suspect that\u2019s quite a big cohort of people.So we\u2019ve definitely had a big effect, the Covid. And it\u2019s ongoing because the NHS is catching up now. And I think that the whole process can be expensive for a self-funder if you include MRI scanning and biopsies and the like.So are you optimistic that the NHS will be able to pick up some of this? Or, how would you advise somebody listening to this who has an early stage diagnosis and has been delayed?First of all, I think these sorts of interviews are really helpful to patients to sort of understand the issues. And I think you\u2019ve got to understand the issues. And you can be very clear on what questions you\u2019re trying to ask when when you have a PSA blood test. You know, what is it you want to know? And then we have an MRI scan. What how are you going to act on it? And then when you have a biopsy, what treatment are you likely to have or not have? I mean if you really think about it, the active surveillance group shouldn\u2019t really exist because, you know, if you have an MRI scan that is normal, you know, why we biopsying them?And if a patient is found to have a cancer and then you say we\u2019ll leave it alone, well again, that doesn\u2019t make sense, because before you biopsy them, you should say to them, what are you going to do if I find a cancer? And you say the likelihood is if I finally cancer with a normal MRI scan is that it\u2019s not gonna be an aggressive one. So why am I biopsying you?So I think patients really need to be first of all clear on what they\u2019re asking and what they\u2019re going to find. But if they decide that they do want to proceed.Am I optimistic that the NHS will catch up? Well, I have found in my experience that the NHS will not tend to have specialists who do nothing else but report MRI scans. So the quality of their MRI is variable. It\u2019s very hard to put value on it. And then when they do the biopsies, they don\u2019t necessarily do them in a way that I would say minimises false negatives.I think they\u2019re more obsessed about doing it in a way that is quick, easy. And for example, there are different ways and taking biopsies, you can do it through perineum but through one or two holes rather than through 20 holes. So, I think maybe, perhaps nobody\u2019s looking at the efficacy of the interventions and what they are trying to find.So, yes, I think patients need to ask that question to the urologist saying, how do you know the MRI scan\u2019s up to scratch? Will it serve my purpose?It\u2019s almost like a supply chain, you know, audit.Yeah.There are these key stages, as you say, that have a massive impact on the sequential stage.Absolutely right. People often get to the end of the pathway without even thinking about what they\u2019re gonna do with the information or how valid the information is.Alan, I really want to thank you for your insights. I think this has been incredibly helpful, certainly for me, but especially for our patients who are listening.If you\u2019d like a consultation with Alan Doherty, please contact us at The Focal Therapy Clinic.And if you\u2019d like to learn more about focal therapy and engage with patients who have chosen to undergo focal therapy instead of active surveillance, please visit our website at\u00a0www.thefocaltherapyclinic.co.uk.
