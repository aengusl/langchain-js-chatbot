{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world, and its early detection is vital to saving the lives of patients. In this research, a novel label-free photoelectrochemical immunosensor was designed for sensitive detection of prostate specific antigen (PSA). Ag2S sensitized on Ag/AgBr/BiOBr heterojunction could effectively inhibit photogenic holes recombination and improve photocurrent response and sensitivity. Ascorbic acid was an effective electron donor, which can effectively eliminate photo-generated holes. The photocurrent reduced linearly with the logarithm of PSA concentration ranged from 0.001 to 50 ng\u00b7mL-1 and the limit of detection was 0.25 pg\u00b7mL-1. The designed sensor had the advantages of wide linear range, good stability, high reproducibility, and good selectivity. This study not only provided a method for efficient and sensitive detection of PSA, but also provided valuable reference ideas for the detection of other tumor markers.", "metaData": {"source": "Baseline quality of life of patients with advanced prostate cancer.
