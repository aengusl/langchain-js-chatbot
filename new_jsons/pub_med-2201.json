{"pageContent": "Objective: To investigate the circulating tumour cells (CTCs) capture abilities of two technologies that are not dependent on cell-surface marker expression: a selection-free platform [AccuCyte\u00ae -CyteFinder\u00ae system (Rarecyte)] and a size-based platform [fluid-assisted separation technology (FAST)]. In addition, the combination of the two systems to more completely assess CTCs was investigated.", "metaData": {"source": "Poor Follow-up After Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen Tests: A Population-based Cohort Study\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29433987/"}}
