{"pageContent": "Aim: Radical treatment of prostate cancer (PCa) is often associated with the development of urinary incontinence (UI). The etiology of UI after prostatectomy is multifactorial and can be caused by both urethral sphincter deficiency and bladder dysfunction. To date, there are no comparative studies of the development of UI in patients after either organ-preserving treatment or radical prostatectomy (RP). Considering this fact, our aim was to carry out the comparative assessment of urodynamic changes in these categories of patients.", "metaData": {"source": "Survival and quality of life outcomes of high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment of localized prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32647645/"}}
