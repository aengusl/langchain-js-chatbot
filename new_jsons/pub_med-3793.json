{"pageContent": "Transrectal ultrasonography is a new procedure for detecting prostate cancer. Better imaging of the prostate results in a better understanding of the appearance of prostate cancer and a heightened awareness of cancer location within the prostate. The appearance of malignancy frequently is a hypoechoic lesion, most often in the peripheral zone of the prostate. Biopsy of suspected areas of the prostate is also more accurate when done in conjunction with transrectal ultrasonography, which also allows evaluation of lesions not yet palpable on rectal examination. This has introduced the concepts of early detection and mass screening for prostate cancer. Although controversial and limited by low specificity, transrectal ultrasonography is a valuable addition for better detection of prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Focal therapy in prostate cancer: A review of seven common controversies\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27846402/"}}
