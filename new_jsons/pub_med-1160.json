{"pageContent": "Common genitourinary health issues that arise in the care of male patients include prostatitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, urogenital cancers, premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction. Bacterial infections are responsible for only 5 to 10 percent of prostatitis cases. Benign prostatic hyperplasia is present in 90 percent of men by the age of 85. Common urogenital cancers include prostate cancer, transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and testicular cancer. Although an estimated 10 percent of men eventually develop prostate cancer, screening for this malignancy is one of the most controversial areas of health prevention. Premature ejaculation occurs in as many as 40 percent of men. Treatment with tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, counseling or behavioral therapy may be helpful. Erectile dysfunction affects up to 30 percent of men between 40 and 70 years of age. Stepped therapy is a useful approach to this common malady. Good treatment results have been obtained with orally administered sildenafil and intraurethrally administered alprostadil.", "metaData": {"source": "The unique needs of couples experiencing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20169495/"}}
