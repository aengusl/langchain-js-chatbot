{"pageContent": "Among the heterogeneous population of patients with prostate cancer, a high-risk group with locally advanced prostate cancer (LAPC) present a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. Although the incidence of LAPC has decreased with screening since the introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, significantly many patients are still diagnosed with LAPC. These patients are by definition at higher risk of metastatic disease and worse outcomes. The role of radical prostatectomy (RP) in this population has been debated, as the combination of radiotherapy and hormonal therapy is becoming used more frequently for LAPC. Unfortunately, the clinical staging and evaluation of LAPC is a challenge that results in possibly understaging or overstaging these patients. This further complicates therapeutic decision-making, and as a result no established standard treatment has been proposed. Like other patients with prostate cancer, individualized therapeutic choices are essential and depend on a multitude of factors. Herein we examine the role of RP for managing LAPC and attempt to emphasize how the risk of distant disease and difficulty with clinical staging might favour incorporating a surgical approach as part of the therapy for patients with LAPC.", "metaData": {"source": "Antiandrogens prevent stable DNA-binding of the androgen receptor\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16141232/"}}
