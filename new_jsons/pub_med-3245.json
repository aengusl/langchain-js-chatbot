{"pageContent": "Purpose: A prior report suggested that radical prostatectomy may confer a survival advantage to patients with metastatic castration recurrent prostate cancer. Therefore, a pooled analysis of 9 trials performed by Cancer and Leukemia Group B was done to determine if men with metastatic castration recurrent prostate cancer who underwent prior prostatectomy had improved clinical outcomes, such as overall, prostate specific, progression-free and PSA progression-free survival, than men who did not undergo prior prostatectomy.", "metaData": {"source": "Pathological examination of radical prostatectomy specimens in men with very low risk disease at biopsy reveals distinct zonal distribution of cancer in black American men\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23770146/"}}
