{"pageContent": "The early detection of asymptomatic prostate cancer has led to the increased incidence of tumours that are unlikely to become symptomatic during life, so called indolent cancers. The prediction of low risk and indolent prostate cancer is needed to avoid overtreatment by unnecessary invasive therapies, and select men for active surveillance. Some of the currently available nomograms predicting these low risk tumours have been validated in independent populations. However, assessment to the compliance with their treatment advises based on the calculation of probability are scarce. The ultimate value of nomograms for the urologic practice can only be assessed by analysing their practical implementation.", "metaData": {"source": "ROLE OF ANDROGEN RECEPTOR-TARGETED AGENTS IN LOCALIZED PROSTATE CANCER\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36938555/"}}
