{"pageContent": " foreign we kind of covered the overview of what Gleason four plus three equals 7 looks like kind of with the difference between three and four versus four and three but today I want to talk about treatments so being in that category I think a lot of people have concerned that the number four is first and that the Gleason score is higher and therefore they can no longer do maybe they were thinking of active surveillance I think a lot of people wonder if they can do active surveillance in this case so why can't\n patients do active surveillance in four plus three well yeah it's not typically recommended to do active surveillance with four plus three uh there certainly are exceptions the reason of course is that three doesn't spread for can spread and that of course is a defining issue is whether or not the cancer spreads if it doesn't spread it's really a harmless benign tumor if it does spread now it's starting to behave like a cancer the empiric idea then that anyone with four plus three must be treated is reasonably\n well grounded the exceptions would be in people that have uh that are somewhat older people who have perhaps very small amounts of four and have other favorable uh characteristics and specifically of course some people that have negative psma pet scans that don't show any spread but it would still be unorthodox to be monitoring four plus three everything in the decision about treatment versus observation is based on well how noxious is the treatment if we can come up with a rather simple treatment that doesn't cause lasting\n harm to the sexual and urinary function then you know the arguments for doing active surveillance are not nearly as strong so it's uh all about a calculation of the risk of spread and the implications of spread on quality of life versus the implications of the treatment impacting quality of life so let's say that someone with a Gleason four plus three goes and gets a pet scan and they find that the cancer is localized to the prostate how do you determine what are the next steps for treatment well of course it depends on the patient's goals\n if uh if you have a somewhat elderly patient who's no longer sexually active I would tend to steer them towards some sort of simple radiation The Cure rates are going to be very high and in centers of excellence now they're you know and with the use of space or there's really relatively little damage as a result of the treatment other than the possibility of erectile dysfunction so in people that are younger of course the issue would be is there is the disease unilateral would it be amenable to some sort of focal therapy\n we've had good results with focal brachytherapy Tulsa Pro is starting to pick up momentum and looking good for focal therapy and the incidence of erectile dysfunction from focal therapy is quite a bit reduced over treating the whole prostate and then if people have bilateral disease then they're sort of obligated to be thinking of some sort of whole prostate treatment usually some sort of brachytherapy with or without some supplemental hormones or possibly prophylactic radiation to their pelvic lymph nodes all these things are\n basically projections on How likely is it that there's some disease outside even though the psma Pet Scan shows that it's clear so you mentioned you know it matters where how many tumors there are and where they are at so can you kind of describe the prostate and the different sections and what you would prescribe focal therapy for in those situations there's been so much new technology in the last 10 15 years that allows us to Define where the cancer is inside the prostate and historically there's been a\n lot of uncertainty about that and for good reasons and as a precaution the whole prostate is treated as a standard it's the idea of doing focal therapy was not thought to be feasible because you there's uncertainty as to whether there would be other tumors or unexplained cancers in corners of the gland that were missed and that was based in the proposition that almost everyone was diagnosed on the basis of a random biopsy and we knew that random biopsies were missing significant cancer about 20 percent of the time so you don't want to\n go in and do a partial treatment and then be left with a mess later that you can't fix but we have much better technology now for localizing cancer within the prostate with three Tesla you know multi-parametric MRIs and now with psma pet scans you can be quite confident that you know where the cancer is so all you're left with now is the need for an expert who's good at targeting that area of the gland with an appropriate margin and thus focal therapy is quite feasible and if men do develop a new cancer in the\n untreated prostate then an additional focal treatment can be administered to that area of the prostate as well so focal therapy is a very reasonable proposition in people who have been carefully staged with the appropriate methodologies and who have access to a maven who's really developed skills for doing focal therapy and it's all dependent on knowing exactly where the the tumor is within the prostate so how do you suggest that someone finds a maven who is skilled in focal therapy I think it's by reputation Word of Mouth\n probably the patient support groups are the a good resource for people where they are in a certain Community where they know the kinds of outcomes that their doctors are delivering and also of course online reviews I think have value there's I know they can be manipulated to some degree but I still think they're useful so as far as the the side effects of focal therapy compared to other forms of radiation I would imagine that focal therapy is a lot less what side effects for radiation in general if you're doing\n the whole prostate can they expect well there's an age-dependent risk of erectile dysfunction so with whole prostate radiation therapy if you take a 65 year old who's not using any Viagra Cialis prior to the onset of the radiation you're looking at about a 30 35 percent chance of serious erectile dysfunction subsequent to the radiation that you know appearing within the next year or two that will not respond to Seattle serviagra so that that's that risk will go even higher in 75 and 70 and 75 year olds it'll be somewhat Less\n in 50 and 55 year olds what about haifu this is like marketed a lot in the world of prostate well it's it's an operator dependent procedure just like any radiation or surgery so finding someone that's very good at it is important insurance coverage has been a little spotty so it can be more expensive haifu I think is adapts reasonably well to focal therapy so if the doctor has skills in you know localized in the tumor and and has good accuracy with their Administration haifu can work very nicely for um\n for focal therapy Tulsa Pro is a modified type of haifu typical haifu is administered through the rectal wall from the rectum into the prostate Tulsa Pro is administered through the urethra out into the gland so the urethra is in the middle of the prostate and the haifu fires out from the urethra the advantage of the Tulsa Pro is that it's done directly under MRI Vision so they can see where they're going when they're doing the treatment so so there's a lot of potential arguments in favor of Tulsa\n Pro the it's new and so the doctors are still in their learning curve but it looks very hopeful going forward are there any urinary issues or Scar Tissue issues with tulsapro telesopro can be repurposed for the treatment of BPH because as men get older they get compression on the urethra and the Tulsa Pro which fires out from the urethra can actually open up the urinary passageway so it could actually lead to help men who are struggling with urinary problems due to their be pH as they get older so I think the biggest question that\n patients have when it comes to these specific types of cases is what are our survival rates well modern survival rates with Gleason four plus three in men that have been diagnosed through screening with PSA are incredibly good I wouldn't say that the 10-year survival rate for a properly treated diagnosed and treated people is in the range of 99 who is the one percent there are freakish unusual strange types of prostate cancer that can behave in a very aggressive fashion but they're rare most of these men are\n going to get cured and and the small percentage that aren't cured are going to be controllable for 10 to 20 years with hormone treatment so how would your opinion for treatments change if somebody has seminal vesicle Invasion well if there's similar vesicle invasion in the old days we used to think well that's a high risk of spread to other parts of the body but now with psma pet scans we can rule out that proposition so people with seminal vesicle Invasion just need a skillful doctor who knows how to cover the seminal vesicles with\n radiation or whatever form of treatment that's being administered so it doesn't have the same frightening implications that we we applied to seminal vesicle invasion in the past because we have better technology through psma pet scans to know if there's anything beyond in the lift notes for example so PS my pet scan will say yes there is a lymph node metastasis or no there isn't a lymph node metastasis in the past all we had were CAT scans and MRIs and so we would see seminal vesicle Invasion and we'd\n say well there could be lymph node metastasis but we don't really know so we have to take extra precautions given the fact that there's a higher risk of lymph node metastasis when you have seminal vesicle Invasion so I've heard patients who have had seminal vesicle Invasion and their doctors automatically putting them on hormone therapy for the fear of metastasis so would you say with psma scans that they don't have to do this well I think it becomes part of the conversation the whole staging and\n treatment Milo has been radically altered by the Advent of psma pet scans we know that hormone therapy has noxious side effects and that sometimes can be lingering lifelong and so it's not a small decision to take away a man's testosterone uh we do know that it's an efficacious treatment and of course it's considered routine and anyone with proven lymph node disease it works it saves lives but in men that don't have proven lymph node disease what are we to do we don't have long-term studies uh I\n think it just needs to be explained to patients that curates can probably be enhanced to a modest degree with the use of hormone therapy but when people hear about the potential side effects of the hormone therapy they may decide that the Improvement the small Improvement in curates may not may not be justified so saying someone had a radiation and the doctor treated the seminal vesicles and they had a psma there's no other signs how frequent should those psma scans be after the form of radiation to make sure\n it isn't metastasizing somewhere yeah we're not routinely doing psma pet scans in men that have very low PSA levels after treatment PSA at very low levels is a strong and accurate indication that the disease is completely in check but if someone starts to develop a rising PSA even above 0.2.\n 3 it's easy to do these scans and and why not double check but many of these men's are after radiation now living with undetectable PSAs and I don't see any reason to be doing routine psma pet scans in those individuals I think oftentimes what people are writing in they're wondering why we're not talking about surgery as an option especially when you're in this Gleason grade four plus three and there's a four present so why aren't you a fan of surgery other side effects the finest surgeons and there's a number of\n really excellent ones out there really can't guarantee you that you'll have control of your urine after surgery they'll say it's unlikely that you'll be incontinent but even the finest surgeons number of studies shown that there's a five to ten percent chance that you're going to end up with serious incontinence for life after surgery what's not talked about is that there's a much higher incidence of stress incontinence meaning when you cough jump or laugh you squirt a little urine\n and that's up to about 50 even with good surgeons and sadly of course then there's a condition called climacteria where men during sexual activity will actually ejaculate urine so these aspects of uh of you know surgery side effects are completely avoidable with radiation and surgery can't promise you higher cure rates The Cure rates are probably comparable or certainly no better than what can be achieved with modern radiation why all the enthusiasm for surgery well historically radiation was much worse the technology with\n radiation has evolved radically in the last 10 15 years so that they have they are now on par with cure rates with surgery without the side effects but if you go back 10 15 years you wouldn't want to go near radiation because of the really scary bad permanent Burns that were happening and the and the lower cure rates that were happening so radiation therapy is trying to overcome a bad reputation which was well deserved if you go back 15 20 years ago but as of with modern technology it's not not at all deserved it's a it's a completely\n new world thanks for talking about that we have some viewers who have seen our Channel and know your viewpoints on surgery but if somebody's you know coming to this video for the first time we definitely wanted to mention that thank you so much for watching this video on Gleason four plus three we know that there are a lot of intricate details when it comes to your prostate cancer case and we want to help you break that down please remember that the research that you do outside of that doctor's office is greatly going to\n affect what happens inside that doctor's office write your questions ahead of time I know you're tired of me saying it but I cannot tell you how important this is you guys have like 10 to 15 minutes maybe if you're lucky 30 minutes with your physician usually and a lot of times when we're in that moment we don't remember everything we're dealing with outside of that office so please write that questions down take somebody with you and remember that your quality of life matters so ask the questions you\n may be even intimidated to ask we understand that they're medical professionals and you may feel like you're the patient but oftentimes you've researched more about your case than that doctor has and it's not anything to the doctors we respect them we love them we appreciate all the hard work that they're doing and their expertise obviously they're there to help us but the biggest person who's going to have the most impact in your medical team is you so thank you so much for your time\n PC your eyes always here for you go ahead and call us if you have questions you can see our website at pcri.org to submit that and leave your comments and your topics and
