{"pageContent": "Radiation therapy (RT) is one of the treatment options for prostate cancer (PCa). Transperineal low-dose rate brachytherapy (BT) is another safe and effective technique for low-risk PCa. Recurrence after RT for localized PCa can be defined by a PSA value of 2 ng/mL above the nadir after RT, and biochemical recurrence (BCR) rate after RT is 40-60 %. In case of radiorecurrent PCa, treatment options include salvage radical prostatectomy (RP), cryotherapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), and salvage BT. Only salvage RP has cancer control results for over 10-year follow-up in a substantial portion of patients (30-40 %). However, salvage RP is technically demanding, and experienced surgeons are needed; in fact, RT-induced cystitis, fibrosis, and tissue plane obliteration can lead to significant complications, such as rectal injuries, anastomotic stricture, and urinary incontinence. This review describes indications, oncologic and functional outcomes, surgical techniques, and complications of salvage robot-assisted RP.", "metaData": {"source": "SIU/ICUD Consultation on Urethral Strictures: Posterior urethral stenosis after treatment of prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24361008/"}}
