{"pageContent": "Purpose of review: Evolution in the management of prostate cancer includes increased attention being paid to patient quality of life after treatment, specifically with issues related to sexual function. Erectile dysfunction is one of the major concerns of patients undergoing treatment for prostate cancer. There are several recognized factors that determine the postoperative incidence of erectile difficulties, including patient age, degree of cavernosal nerve sparing during surgery, cancer stage, and associated vascular comorbidities. Early initiation of rehabilitation protocols after radical prostatectomy has been advocated to promote the speed and degree of recovery of erectile function. The aim of this communication is to review recent initiatives in erectile dysfunction restoration after prostate cancer therapy.", "metaData": {"source": "Oncologic outcome, side effects and comorbidity of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for localized prostate cancer.
