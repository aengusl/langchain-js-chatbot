{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men, and biologically shows highly heterogeneous clinical outcomes, despite early detection. Therefore, the identification of novel molecular markers that are associated with biological aggressiveness is very important for prostatic cancer clinical outcome predictions and treatment choices. Here, we investigate quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase 1 (QSOX1) expression and evaluate its clinicopathological significance and prognostic impact in prostate cancers, with immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. QSOX1 over-expression was observed in 12 (11.2%) of prostate cancers. High QSOX1 expression significantly associated with prostate cancer with vascular invasion, neural invasion, extra prostatic extension, higher pT stage, higher pathological tumor stage, higher prognostic grouping, and higher grades groups, but did not associated with worse overall survival. High QSOX1 expression correlates with tumor invasiveness and Gleason grade, reflects aggressive tumor features, and could be an important biomarker and therapeutic target.", "metaData": {"source": "Comparative risk-adjusted mortality outcomes after primary surgery, radiotherapy, or androgen-deprivation therapy for localized prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20690197/"}}
