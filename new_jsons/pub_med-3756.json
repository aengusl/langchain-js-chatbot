{"pageContent": "The value of screening for prostate cancer has been a contentious issue within the medical literature for several decades. At the crux of the matter lies a judgment call of whether the potential benefits of screening, a reduction in prostate cancer and all-cause mortality, outweigh the limitations, overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The study by Schr\u03c6der et al. reports 9, 11 and 13-year follow-up data on men participating in the European randomized study of screening for prostate cancer (ERSPC). While the authors report a significant reduction in prostate cancer mortality, they conclude that potential harms associated with screening currently circumvent any recommendation for a population-based approach to screening for prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-ligand positron emission tomography and radioligand therapy (RLT) of prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32147685/"}}
