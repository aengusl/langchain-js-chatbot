{"pageContent": "Coming to terms with disease, chronic illness, and aging may be challenging for men who adhere to an inflexible gender schema. In this study of elder U.S. veterans' ideas about masculinity, we find that prostate cancer patients reaffirm a strongly moral normalizing discourse about \"being a man\" yet tend to separate roles and values from male physical and sexual attributes. Using systematic data collection methods taken from cognitive anthropology, we map veterans' schema of masculinity and examine the relative importance that cancer patients and non-patients give to gender attributes. The results demonstrate the complementarity between cognitive and narrative approaches in medical anthropology. This research also suggests the hypotheses that (1) coming to terms with iatrogenesis may involve a subtle reformulation of masculinity and that (2) men with a fixed view of masculinity may have worse health outcomes than do those who accept the changes accompanying their treatment for prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Health-related quality of life after prostate brachytherapy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15329098/"}}
