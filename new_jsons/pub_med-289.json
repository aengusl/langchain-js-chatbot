{"pageContent": "Treatments for localized prostate cancer include radical prostatectomy, brachytherapy, conformal external beam irradiation, and focused ultrasound. This paper describes the oncologic and functional results of each approach. The treatment choice depends on the patient's general status and on the results of biopsy and imaging studies. Watchful waiting and hormone therapy are other options for elderly patients.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate-specific antigen vs. magnetic resonance imaging parameters for assessing oncological outcomes after high intensity-focused ultrasound focal therapy for localized prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27663393/"}}
