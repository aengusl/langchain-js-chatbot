{"pageContent": "Sexual health is compromised by the diagnosis and treatment of virtually all cancer types. Despite the prevalence and negative impact of sexual dysfunction, sexual health clinics are the exception in cancer centers. Consequently, there is a need for effective, efficient, and inclusive sexual health programming in oncology. This paper describes the development of the innovative Sexual Health Clinic (SHC) utilizing a hybrid model of integrated in-person and virtual care. The SHC evolved from a fusion of the in-person and virtual prostate cancer clinics at Princess Margaret. This hybrid care model was adapted to include six additional cancer sites (cervical, ovarian, testicular, bladder, kidney, and head and neck). The SHC is theoretically founded in a biopsychosocial framework and emphasizes interdisciplinary intervention teams, participation by the partner, and a medical, psychological, and interpersonal approach. Virtual visits are tailored to patients based on biological sex, cancer type, and treatment type. Highly trained sexual health counselors facilitate the virtual clinic and provide an additional layer of personalization and a \"human touch\". The in-person visits complement virtual care by providing comprehensive sexual health assessment and sexual medicine prescription. The SHC is an innovative care model which has the potential to close the gap in sexual healthcare. The SHC is designed as a transferable, stand-alone clinic which can be shared with cancer centers.", "metaData": {"source": "Patient and community preferences for outcomes in prostate cancer: implications for clinical policy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12544552/"}}
