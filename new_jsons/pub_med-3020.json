{"pageContent": "Nomograms have been developed to predict prostate cancer (PCa) related outcomes. We report what has been achieved and what can be expected in 2007 and in the future. We reviewed the literature to provide guidelines in terms of criteria, limitations and clinical value of nomograms in 2007. Further, we report a set of recent PCa nomograms, where certain criteria are listed which were used to develop each nomogram. Our findings suggest a demand for an update of nomograms as well as head-to-head comparisons to determine the best-suited model in select fields of PCa outcomes. In 2007 and the future, an increasing number of nomograms will address important endpoints such as PSA recurrence, local and distant metastases, or androgen-independent PCa-specific survival. Our results suggest that nomograms represent valid risk stratification models to achieve most accurate predictions. In 2007 and the future, more specific and refined nomograms will be available which address relevant clinical end points. Moreover, novel markers in PCa outcomes will be quantified using the nomogram approach.", "metaData": {"source": "Measuring health related quality of life in men with prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7933244/"}}
