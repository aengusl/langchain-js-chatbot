{"pageContent": "Purpose: Controversy exists over the optimal treatment for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. Almost all of the treatment results are from non-randomized trials and interseries comparison is difficult since the apparent success of a treatment, as judged by the actuarial freedom from relapse and survival data, depends on patient selection criteria and post-treatment evaluation, in addition to the efficacy of the therapeutic intervention. In this report the calculation of a hazard function is used to estimate and compare the rate of relapse for the different treatments.", "metaData": {"source": "Variation in Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing Rates and Prostate Cancer Treatments and Outcomes in a National 20-Year Cohort\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33999165/"}}
