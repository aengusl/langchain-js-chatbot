{"pageContent": "Suppression of androgen levels in blood of stage D2 prostate cancer patients has been the prominent treatment for advanced prostate cancer. However, the duration of hormone sensitivity of prostate tumor is variable. The type of initial response to hormonal treatment, the length of response and patient's survival are in direct association with disease aggressiveness. Recently, an arithmetic formula expressing disease aggressivity was computed using pretreatment values of prostatic acid phosphatase (P.A.P.), alkaline phosphatase (A.P.), degree of tumor differentiation and number of bone metastases. This aggressiveness score was related to disease response and patients outcome receiving hormonal treatments. The use of an arithmetic formula to express disease aggressivity could result in a subdivision of the disease. The identification of the subgroup of stage D2 patients destined not to benefit from hormonal manipulation could change the strategies employed up until today for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Long-term survival and mortality in prostate cancer treated with noncurative intent\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7541864/"}}
