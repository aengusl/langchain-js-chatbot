{"pageContent": "Although there is little evidence that sexual behavior causes prostate cancer, men with prostate cancer often have sexual dysfunction before the cancer diagnosis is made. Each treatment for prostate cancer increases the prevalence of sexual problems. After nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, the chance of recovering erections is better for men who are younger and in whom both neurovascular bundles can be spared. Definitions of \"potency\" after nerve-sparing surgery have not specified the rigidity of the erections achieved. Thus, some men classified as \"potent\" may wish additional sexual rehabilitation. The chance that definitive radiation therapy will cause erectile dysfunction probably has been overestimated. The prevalence rate may be closer to 25% of men with new problems compared with the 50% often cited in the literature. Men are more at risk to have erection problems after radiation therapy if the quality of erections before treatment was borderline. Hormonal therapy has an impact on the central mechanisms mediating sexual desire and arousability. Therefore, with most treatment methods, only approximately 20% of men remain sexually functional. Newer antiandrogenic drugs interfere less with sexual function, but their long-term ability to control prostate cancer is still under investigation. Sexual rehabilitation should be addressed by the primary care team. Sexual partners should be included in brief sexual counseling, even when a mechanical treatment for erectile dysfunction is prescribed.", "metaData": {"source": "Depression and prostate cancer: implications for urologists and oncologists\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32733038/"}}
