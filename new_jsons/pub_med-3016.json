{"pageContent": "Exercise and physical activity have been linked to the prevention of certain types of cancer such as colon and breast. As prostate cancer is the most common malignancy diagnosed in the male population, there is obvious interest in determining a possible effect of exercise on disease prevention and improvement of disease-related outcomes. Thus far, data has been conflicting and there has been no clear determination of prostate cancer prevention through exercise. However, as prostate cancer treatment carries many side effects which may be bothersome and health-threatening, researchers have examined the effects of exercise training on reducing treatment-related complications and improving outcomes and quality of life (QOL). In this review, we discuss the impact of exercise on reducing side effects of prostate cancer treatment and improving cancer-specific and overall survival outcomes, as well as improving QOL in prostate cancer patients.", "metaData": {"source": "Chemotherapy and novel therapeutics before radical prostatectomy for high-risk clinically localized prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25596644/"}}
