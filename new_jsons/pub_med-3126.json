{"pageContent": "(Background) Radiation failure for localized prostate cancer is seen in 20-60% of patients who do not undergo extirpative surgery. Though potentially curative, salvage prostatectomy (SS) has not been frequently performed historically due to high rates of complications and postoperative incontinence. With the advent of robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy, these rates appear to be improved. Retzius-sparing approaches have additionally been shown to improve continence outcomes in the index setting, and may further improve continence outcomes in salvage cases while maintaining oncologic integrity. (Methods) We performed a literature review and qualitative analysis of published papers on salvage Retzius-sparing robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (SRS). Three studies met criteria and were included in analysis. (Results) There were more patients with Gleason Grade Group 1 disease after initial treatment in the SRS group vs. SS (22% vs. 8%). Patients most frequently underwent external beam radiation therapy in both groups (52% vs. 49%). 30-day complication rates were 10% and 26% for SRS and SS, respectively. Continence outcomes were significantly improved in SRS with 59% of continence (based on study criteria) compared to 38% in SS. Time to continence was similarly improved for SRS. Positive surgical margins and biochemical recurrence were not significantly different between SRS and SS in any study. (Conclusions) SRS is a safe and feasible option for salvage treatment of localized prostate cancer and may improve postoperative continence outcomes. Positive surgical margin and biochemical recurrence rates are similar to those reported in SS.", "metaData": {"source": "Patient-reported 'ever had' and 'current' long-term physical symptoms after prostate cancer treatments\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25597493/"}}
