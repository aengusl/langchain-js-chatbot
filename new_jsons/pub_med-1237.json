Based on the questionnaire designed by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), the author studied the quality of life in 102 cases of prostate cancer and in 102 controls. With factor analysis method, a 30-item questionnaire was divided into six aspects to evaluate patients' quality of life: (1) activities of daily life; (2) family and social life; (3) physical symptoms of prostate cancer; (4) fatigue and malaise; (5) psychologic disturbance and distress and (6) sexual dysfunction. The results showed that there was statistical importance between each item when comparing case and control groups which proved the questionnaire an appropriate approach in assessing quality of life in patients with prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Patient Education for Radical Prostatectomy: Development of a Program Tailored to the Needs of Prostate Cancer Patients\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34923862/"}}
