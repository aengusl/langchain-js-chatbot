{"pageContent": "To evaluate the value of resistive index (RI) of prostatic capsular arteries in diagnosis and evaluation of prostate cancer (PCa) in Chinese patients undergoing initial prostate biopsy. A total of 532 consecutive patients undergoing prostate biopsy were enrolled in this study. RI was measured on the largest transverse section of prostate for each individual. The predictive value of RI was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. PCa was identified in 217 (40.79%) patients. RI was 0.69 \u00b1 0.08 and 0.8 \u00b1 0.08 for patients without and with PCa (p < 0.01). On logistic regression RI was significantly associated with PCa (p < 0.01). Using ROC analysis RI outperformed tPSA in prediction of PCa in all patients [area under ROC curve (AUC) = 0.83, 0.78, respectively]. With the cutoff value of 0.73, RI discriminated PCa from non-PCa patients with 81.9% sensitivity, 75.9% specificity and 77.63% diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, The AUC for RI in the discrimination of PCa from non-PCa patients in a subset with PSA of 4 to 10 ng/ml, high grade from non-high grade PCa patients and advanced from localized PCa patients was 0.70, 0.77 and 0.80, higher than other parameters (p < 0.05). RI is proved a practicable parameter in identifying patients at risk for PCa and predicting the grade and stage of PCa before initial prostate biopsy. The value of RI should be further explored in the future.", "metaData": {"source": "Editorial Comment for Bolton et al\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25936402/"}}
