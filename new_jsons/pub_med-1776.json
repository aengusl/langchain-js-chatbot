{"pageContent": "Receiving a diagnosis of and treatment for prostate cancer often results in significant physical side-effects and associated psychosocial stressors that can interfere with the experience of sexual intimacy for couples. Despite the fact that prostate cancer affects mainly older men, the maintenance of sexual intimacy is an important issue to consider, as the majority of older adults continue to value, engage in, and enjoy sexual activity throughout their lives. While the current research identifies the challenges that many men face, little is known about the strategies that couples use to successfully maintain sexual intimacy after prostate cancer treatment. In this review article, the existing literature on sexual intimacy after prostate cancer is reviewed, a critical analysis of current limitations in our knowledge and understanding is provided, and directions for further research are suggested.", "metaData": {"source": "One-year urinary and sexual outcome trajectories among prostate cancer patients treated by radical prostatectomy: a prospective study\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34001094/"}}
