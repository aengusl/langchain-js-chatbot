{"pageContent": "Purpose of review: The mainstays of the management of clinically localized prostate cancer have historically rested upon active surveillance, radiation therapy, or radical prostatectomy. Although both radiation and surgical treatment of localized prostate cancer can achieve excellent oncologic outcomes, the subsequent potential adverse effects of urinary stress incontinence and erectile dysfunction are unappealing to patients. This has led to investigational studies centered upon focal treatment of the cancerous lesion, with the aim to improve quality-of-life outcomes. In this review, we describe numerous novel modalities, including nanoparticle ablation and irreversible electroporation, which are being utilized for the focal treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Anxiety symptoms prior to a prostate cancer diagnosis: Associations with knowledge and openness to treatment\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27882638/"}}
