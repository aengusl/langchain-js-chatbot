{"pageContent": "Purpose: The three main treatment options for primary prostate cancer are surgery, radiation, and active surveillance. Surgical and radiation intervention for prostate cancer can be associated with significant morbidity. Therefore, accurate stratification predictive of outcome for prostate cancer patients is essential for appropriate treatment decisions. Nomograms that use clinical and pathologic variables are often used for risk prediction. Favorable outcomes exist even among men classified by nomograms as being at high risk of recurrence.", "metaData": {"source": "Possible prevention and treatment of prostate cancer by exercise\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22792655/"}}
