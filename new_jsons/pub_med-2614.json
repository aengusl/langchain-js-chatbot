Brachytherapy provides highly conformal radiotherapy and delivers tumoricidal doses that exceed those administered with external beam radiation therapy. There is a significant body of literature supporting the excellent long-term oncologic and safety outcomes achieved when brachytherapy is used for men in all risk categories of nonmetastatic prostate cancer.
