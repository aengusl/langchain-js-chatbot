{"pageContent": "External beam radiotherapy (RT) has been used as a curative treatment of prostate cancer for more than 5 decades, with the \"modern\" era emerging more than 3 decades ago. Its history is marked by gradual improvements punctuated by several quantum leaps that are increasingly driven by advancements in the computer and imaging sciences and by its integration with complementary forms of treatment. Consequently, the contemporary use of external beam RT barely resembles its earliest form, and this must be appreciated in the context of current patient care. The influence of predictive factors on the use and outcomes of external beam RT is presented, as is a selected review of the methods and outcomes of external beam RT as a single therapeutic intervention, in association with androgen suppression, or as a postoperative adjunct. Thus, the \"state of the (radiotherapeutic) art\" is presented to enhance the understanding of this treatment approach with the hope that this information will serve as a useful resource to physicians as they care for patients with prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer: non-metastatic\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12230707/"}}
