{"pageContent": "Objective: High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) Focal therapy appears to have encouraging oncologic outcomes and urinary and erectile function. The control of the treated area can be done using contrast enhanced ultrasound with sulfur hexafluoride (Sonovue\u00ae) at the end of the procedure. We report oncological and functional outcomes in HIFU focal therapy (FT) for prostate cancer (PCa) management using sonovue.", "metaData": {"source": "Assessment of high intensity focused ultrasound for the treatment of prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19994799/"}}
