{"pageContent": "Transcript:\n before we get into this video I just wanted to remind you that we're having a Live Free in-person Conference here in Los Angeles California on March 11th and if you would like more information to come join us in person you can click the link in the description below and now here's a video with Dr Scholl's on different types of prostate cancer treatments today Dr Scholls we're talking about four different types of prostate cancer treatments and I think that you know we're not getting the specifics of\n treatment so much but the types of treatment that there are you know there's active surveillance there's localized systemic and then combination therapy I think oftentimes patients hear these terms and it would be nice if we can kind of take them apart and kind of help contextualize the situation for each one so let's take active surveillance first so can you explain what actor surveillance is and then also who would be eligible for this type of treatment right so it was a really revolutionary idea around\n 2005-2006 when certain experts were pointing out that there are types of prostate cancer that simply don't spread and that maybe the treatment for it is more dangerous than the disease itself and that's been validated over the last 15 years and it's quite common about half of the men that are diagnosed every year about a hundred thousand men of the 200 000 total men that are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year have a type of uh prostate cancer that doesn't spread call it a Gleason six and the appropriate thing to do is to\n Simply watch these people we call it active surveillance and what are we watching for if it's not going to spread why watch it all and the answer is that people can get new cancers over time and then there's also the possibility of having two types of cancers at the same time you can have a Gleason six and that's diagnosed on a random biopsy but a higher grade cancer in a corner of the prostate that was missed on the random biopsy people need to be watched for that reason and we call it active surveillance it's uh typically monitored\n by urologists with a random biopsy every couple years to make sure there's no new cancers coming up we've spearheaded at belief recently validated in the New England Journal of Medicine in December of 2022 that you can use MRI and PSA to monitor people and then only do targeted biopsies if a new spot shows up so that's what we call Active surveillance is to get an MRI once a year and do targeted biopsies if new Shadows or spots are growing or changing otherwise just watch people get a PSA a couple\n times a year I appreciate that because I think the two things you highlighted a lot of times patients will ask me if Gleason 6 turns into a more aggressive cancer so the fact that it's a new cancer you're watching for the Gleason 6m itself will not metastasize is quite a fact to pay attention to and the second is the concept of targeted biopsies instead of random needle biopsies random needle biopsies being so um they're done everywhere targeted biopsies are something almost patients have to seek out nowadays so with that\n being said how does one seek out a targeted biopsy well there could be more common many hospitals employ special Radiologists they're called Interventional Radiologists Radiologists that stick needles in people it's not just the prostate it could be the liver it could be a spot on the lung these doctors are trained in being able to use an Imaging methodology see a spot and then take a sample with a needle biopsy and they can do that on prostates as well it's logical to call the local hospital and talk to the Department of\n radio and ask if they have Interventional Radiologists that can do targeted prostate biopsies so the next type of treatment that we're talking about is localized prostate cancer localized treatment localized meaning it remaining in the prostate so what type of treatments do we see when it comes to this well it's a long list and when people talk about treating prostate cancer this is usually what they're talking about because most men are getting PSA screening they're getting diagnosed at a time the disease is still\n contained in the gland and it's curable there's a lot of different approaches historically surgery has been very popular I've been a little disenchanted with surgery over the years because of the greater degree of side effects compared to the all the other options that people have and the list is very long many types of radiation high intensity focused ultrasound electroporation cryotherapy laser treatments some of these directed at treating the whole prostate some are directed at a section where the tumor is\n so-called focal therapy the idea of local treatment as a grab bag term encompasses all of these things people are in sort of a shopping mode learning about the pros and cons some of these things are not covered by Insurance some are so they're looking at costs and whether their insurance will cover it and so that is in a very quick review as what we call local treatments when it comes to the Gleason grade can you have like Gleason 9 and keep it localized and treat it is there a certain like lease and grade that's more likely to\n metastasize yes there is a concern as the Gleason score goes up that disease May spread outside the prostate and sometimes precautions are needed and local treatment alone may not be appropriate for those individuals we're getting a little more bold with using local treatment and high Gleason scores now that we have psma pet scans in the cases where it does not show any spread so that is a dynamic area that's evolving right now is how much of any additional treatment is necessary if someone has a higher Gleason score and\n historically there was always additional treatment administered hormone therapy and whatnot but now that is being Revisited so since you mentioned hormone therapy we're talking about the concept that there could be microscopic activity of prostate cancer in the blood can you talk about systemic therapies and really what is that a whole idea of what we call Micro metastasis or even if there are visible metastases and involves a conclusion that disease outside the prostate is in locations that are not a hundred percent sure is there any type\n of a medicine you could give that could circulate through the bloodstream and kill prostate cancer anywhere in the body even if we didn't see it or know where it's located and the answer is yes there are medicines like that and particularly potent ones for prostate cancer patients called hormonal medicines these medicines eradicate testosterone circulating in the bloodstream and in certain cases even testosterone that's being produced inside cancer cells under the umbrella of that type of systemic therapy\n prostate cancers die off and in some cases can be eliminated and this is a very effective strategy that's been shown to prolong life and and improve cure rates and is mainstream Prostate Cancer Care so this is the word systemic therapy really is just an umbrella term for any medicine that is injected into the bloodstream that circulates throughout the body could be a form of chemotherapy it could be a form of immune therapy a type of hormonal therapy but the word systemic means that it covers the whole body so drugs like radium-223 zofigo\n would be considered systemic yes okay and then what about luticium also okay A lot of times patients can get very fearful they're thinking like oh something's being injected and it's in my whole body and what type of side effects will I get from something that is now running through my bloodstream can you talk about the typical side effects that you see with systemic therapies well it is a real issue and of course it varies depending on the type of treatment if it's a hormonal treatment or a chemotherapy treatment or\n a radiation treatment the good news is that modern systemic therapies I mean if you go back 30 40 years the word chemotherapy gave people of the conniptions it was so relatively ineffective and quite toxic but modern medicines are much more targeted and have predictable side effects that can be modulated based on dose and oftentimes the the payoff the anti-cancer effect is so much greater than the side effects that these are very valuable tools now not everyone needs them some people have localized disease and it would be Overkill to be\n administering medicines to the whole body when it's really not called for but the modern systemic therapies all have their potential side effects and I don't want to over minimize them we certainly don't have time to go through in detail all that all the unusual and and common and uncommon side effects that they they all can cause but for the most part in people that have a risk of disease that spread the disease is far more dangerous and potentially a much greater concern than the side effects of the treatment\n one thing I noticed that you and Dr moyad highlighted in a recent conference is how different taxider and Jeff Tana which are our well-known you know prostate cancer chemotherapies are compared to tax same-based chemos that are in other types of cancer and so it seems like the side effects when the word chemo is brought up when we think think of it because of you know the movies or maybe experiences that people have had they think of such extreme side effects but it seems like a lot of those side effects are kind of mitigated in\n prostate cancer and that it's a lot more tolerable than people think is that true it's very true the women who receive taxing therapy or the lung cancer patients that are treated with taxing therapy are given a higher dose of taxider or Joe Tana plus two or three additional drugs at the same time the medicines that are administered to prostate cancer patients are in diminished doses as single agents relative to what chemotherapy is for other cancer types chemotherapy for prostate cancer is is quite a bit milder\n so next up let's talk about combination therapies now this is also kind of an intimidating Prospect for many patients because they think they're going to get a lot of you know therapies all at once and they're concerned about side effects and um quality of life and it being tolerable so first of all can you define what combination therapy can look like for a prostate cancer patient so we've talked about local treatments we've talked about systemic treatments and the one type of combination therapist where\n those are given at the same time as we talked about earlier people with high Gleason scores there's a possibility of microscopic spread so that local treatment is to get rid of the primary tumor in the prostate gland the systemic therapy is to take care of any potential microscopic disease that may be in another part of the body the combination of the two what we call combination therapy is is going to give the best cure rates in these patients with higher grade disease combination therapy can also consist of two or three hormonal\n treatments at the same time hormonal treatments plus chemotherapy treatments and and situations where people have proven spread to the bones for example so combination therapy is a very general term but it is describing the fact that certain types of prostate cancer the more serious types are going to respond better to multiple agents than they are to just giving one treatment at a time so for patients that you've treated with combination therapy they have tolerated the side effects pretty well from all of it I know that's\n kind of a general question but for the most part they have yes the administration of systemic therapy which is the part that people worry about in terms of General side effects can be it's there's a skill factor there's also a dosing Factor so if people are nervous about side effects they can start off with a smaller dose to see how well that's tolerated see if it's effective and then increase the dose in incremental steps in a manageable way to make sure that it is tolerable there's a lot of ways to soften side\n effects of different medicines people are familiar with exercise to compensate for side effects from hormonal therapy it also helps and people are going through any type of radiation or any type of chemotherapy there's a lot of issues that are are not addressed unfortunately through lack of awareness putting ice in people's mouths during chemotherapy to maintain the healthy taste buds or even on the on the fingertips to maintain you know so there's no damage to the fingernails so there's a lot of little\n tricks that crew for overcoming side effects not all side effects can be managed successfully but with appropriate dosing and other supportive care methods these things are quite tolerable as when they're Justified people would not want to go through any of this sort of thing if they didn't have to but if people are looking for higher cure rates and serious variants of cancer it's e easy to justify it I think you know it's it's so many different treatments and there's so many different aspects and\n ways to mitigate side effects but it's so important to know your stage and it seems like as long as you you're very clear and you know your stage you know your situation you can really customize your Prostate Cancer Care accordingly as I was filming this video with Dr Scholl's I think one thing I wanted to highlight is when we talk about systemic therapies or combination therapies you know localized therapies they're all broad categories there are multiple treatments that are inside of those\n categories and they are all life prolonging we've seen great clinical trials and studies come from these drugs showing that it does extend to life so maybe you're in a situation where the treatment is not working for you no um anymore and it's giving you anxiety maybe your PSA is rising and you're in this situation you're not sure what to do well I want to just tell you there is hope there are so many different types of treatments out there for prostate cancer and there's also clinical trials\n that are good clinical trials that are working and our job here at pcri is to highlight this to you so that you know if you do have anxiety we completely understand but two things I want you to know there is hope and you're not alone we understand that this is an incredibly hard journey you've been through a lot our hearts are with you but we want to know and I know I keep repeating it that there's hope because we've seen so many patients who are in advanced situations who have had these clinical trials done\n or you know they've had these FDA approved treatments and they've lived for so much longer and they've been able to we've been able to be friends with them and experience them and they've lived so much life and I just feel like that that's a really powerful thing to remember when you're in the Journey of a really scary world word called prostate cancer so you know we're here for you if you have questions if you have comments leave them in the comments section below I want to hear your voice I want to know\n what your questions are so that we know the type of content to film if this was helpful for you give us a thumbs up subscribe to our YouTube channel I know I say subscribe it's not just to keep you updated but it's also because YouTube will pick up these videos and share them with other prostate cancer patients who are searching for the same answers that you are thank you so much for trusting us please remember again you're not alone much love to you and I hope you have a great week [Music] thank you\nSUMMARY \nThere are four levels of prostate cancer treatment intensity: active surveillance, localized treatment, systemic therapy, and combination therapy.\nActive surveillance involves monitoring the prostate for new cancers using methods such as MRI and PSA tests.\nLocalized treatment refers to a range of treatments such as surgery, radiation, and various therapies that target specific areas of the prostate.\nSystemic therapy involves medications that circulate throughout the body, such as hormonal treatments, to treat prostate cancer that has spread beyond the prostate.\nCombination therapy involves using multiple treatments simultaneously, which can improve cure rates in patients with more serious types of prostate cancer.",
