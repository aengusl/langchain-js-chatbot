{"pageContent": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), and the alterations induced by ageing on quality of life, urinary and sexual function, and bother. We evaluated 283 patients who filled in and returned the questionnaire used. A total of 105 were treated with RP and were selected prostate cancer patients with localised disease without recurrences. An additional 98 underwent TURP for BPH and a third group consisted of 80 apparently healthy men. The general quality of life was estimated by the Rand 36-Item Health Survey 1.0. Urinary function was estimated by the AUA Symptom Index and the UCLA Prostate Cancer Index (urinary function and bother scale). Sexual function and bother, were explored using the Brief Male Sexual Function Inventory for Urology. Patient outcome 2 years post treatment was compared to the pre-treatment status and to that of the matched control population. General quality of life was not affected by RP or TURP, with the exception of an increase in the emotional/well being domain in RP patients to control group levels. After RP there was more bother reported for the urinary function than urinary malfunction itself, while TURP, as expected, restored urinary function and bother to normal population norms. Elderly males had urinary function and bother similar to the operated patients. Estimating sexual function on RP patients, erectile dysfunction (ED) predominates, leading to decreased sexual life. TURP marginally affects sexual life, mainly due to the loss of ejaculation, while in men from the control group, sexual function, although affected, was still present.", "metaData": {"source": "Editorial comment on: Erectile function in prostate cancer-free patients who underwent prostate saturation biopsy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17619080/"}}
