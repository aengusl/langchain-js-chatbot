It\u2019s only when these men actively seek alternatives that they discover focal therapy \u2013 the \u201cmiddle way\u201d in prostate cancer treatment.A trio of researchers considered the role of focal therapy as an alternative to AS and radical treatments in 2018, and concluded that \u201cfocal therapies have begun to find their \u201cmiddle ground\u201d place between definitive therapies and active follow-up\u201d.A year later, Dr John Davis from the MD Anderson Cancer Centre in Houston, Texas posed the question: \u00a0\u201cIs there a middle ground between Active Surveillance and Definitive Treatment?\u201d at the annual International Prostate Cancer Update.\u00a0 Dr Davis recognised the value of establishing a middle ground but urged caution in defining \u201cendpoints\u201d of that \u201cmiddle\u201d, citing the need for improvement in both MRI and ablation techniques.More recently Dr Steven Scionti, of the Scionti Prostate Centre in Florida, asked \u201cIf there were a clinically and economically balanced approach to detecting and treating prostate cancer, what would it look like?\u201d He examined criteria that would illuminate a logical middle-ground approach to diagnosing and treating prostate cancer, which are as follows:Applying these criteria, Dr Scionti determined HIFU focal therapy to be a \u201cGolden Mean\u201d, standing up well as a logical and balanced response to the needs of today\u2019s patients. He concludes\u201cHIFU is a logical treatment consideration for the following types of patients. Those who are diagnosed with low-to-moderate risk localized prostate cancer may seek a \u201cMiddle Way\u201d or \u201cGolden Mean\u201d between radical whole-gland treatments and observation as a way to buy time before treatment. Those who are drawn to Active Surveillance, including lifestyle changes in diet, exercise, etc. may discuss with their doctors the merits of a focal HIFU treatment as a way to destroy the tumor while preserving their healthy prostate tissue, urinary and sexual function. Those whose cancer has come back after radiotherapy (external beam or seed implants) may logically consider a HIFU ablation as a potentially curative alternative to hormone therapy.\u201dTFTC Consultant Urologist Tim Dudderidge also regards focal therapy as a middle way for many of his patients.\u201cSo we now have a paradox where patients who previously we weren\u2019t treating because the outcomes didn\u2019t seem so good are exactly the patients we need to treat radically, and the patients who get really good outcomes actually maybe they don\u2019t need any treatment at all \u2026and somewhere in the middle is this group of patients where we\u2019re increasingly uncertain about the benefits of more radical treatments, but we\u2019re also a bit uneasy about doing nothing and just monitoring. These patients are the ones where there\u2019s an opportunity to use something less invasive that still gets the advantages of treatment.\u201dThe scope and breadth of the \u201cmiddle way\u201d will continue to evolve and redefine as diagnostics and focal treatments improve, and most importantly as both patients and clinicians become more conversant about individual perspectives on risk and quality of life. It\u2019s not as simple or black and white as \u201ctotal cure with side effects\u201d versus \u201cpartial or temporary cure with no \u00a0side effects\u201d.But one thing is for sure: patients\u2019 knowledge about their treatment options is growing, and their confidence in challenging clinicians and seeking alternative opinions about their care is growing too. This, combined with continual development in approaches to focal therapy and evidence on their efficacy, will both widen and strengthen the Middle Way for prostate cancer treatment.Do you have questions about focal therapy and where it sits between Active Surveillance and other definitive treatments such as radical prostatectomy?
