{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer can be detected incidentally after surgical therapy for benign prostatic obstruction such as holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP), thus called incidental prostate cancer (iPCa). We aimed to review the studies on iPCa detected after HoLEP and investigate its prevalence. A detailed search of original articles was conducted via the PubMed-MEDLINE, Web of Science, Wiley Online Library and Cochrane Library databases in the last 10 years up to 1 May 2021 with the following search string solely or in combination: \"prostate cancer\", \"prostate carcinoma\", \"holmium laser enucleation of the prostate\" and \"HoLEP\". We identified 19 articles to include in our analysis and divided them into six main categories: HoLEP versus open prostatectomy and/or transurethral resection of the prostate in terms of iPCa, oncological and functional outcomes, the role of imaging modalities in detecting iPCa, predictive factors of iPCa, the role of prostate-specific antigen kinetics in detecting iPCa and the management of iPCa after HoLEP. We found that the iPCa after HoLEP rate ranges from 5.64% to 23.3%. Functional and oncological outcomes were reported to be encouraging. Oncological treatment options are available in a wide range.", "metaData": {"source": "Defining the level of evidence for technology adoption in the localized prostate cancer pathway\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24332638/"}}
