{"pageContent": "Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is indicated for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer and locally advanced disease. In addition to sexual side effects, long-term ADT results in several other changes, including hot flashes; gynecomastia; changes in body composition, metabolism, and the cardiovascular system; osteoporosis; anemia; psychiatric and cognitive problems; and fatigue and diminished quality of life.

It is important for clinicians to anticipate these effects and to initiate measures to prevent or minimize them in order to maintain quality of life in prostate cancer survivors.", "metaData": {"source": "Combination surgery for erectile dysfunction and male incontinence\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21956147/"}}
