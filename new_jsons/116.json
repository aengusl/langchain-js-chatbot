Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer amongst men in the UK and with this sombre fact because a multitude of challenges and opportunities. I\u2019m Clare Delmar. Joining me today is Raymond Poole from County Wicklow in Ireland, who is both campaigner and advocate for better treatment and more honest discussion about the impact of prostate cancer on men\u2019s lives. Following the prostate cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment, he has used both poetry and prose to express his emotions, communicate his experience with honesty and humour, and inspire others to develop their voice and make better choices about their prostate cancer support and treatment. He\u2019s Irish so that may not come as a surprise.

You\u2019re in for a treat. Raymond, thank you so much for joining me today. Thanks, Clare. It\u2019s wonderful to be talking to you and great to get advice out there about prostate cancer in men because it\u2019s not spoken about enough. Indeed. And you are my first Irish guest, so I want to commend you for that and it\u2019s very exciting. Great. Yeah. I mean, you know what happens when the Irish start talking? You don\u2019t shut us up. I do, indeed, without further ado, let\u2019s just launch into the very beginning of your journey and ask you to give a short summary of when and how you were diagnosed with prostate cancer and what happened afterwards. Sure, it started back in 2016. I went, I go every year for an annual blood test. In my late forties, I asked the doctor to add in the PSA one. And in July 2016, when I was 53, my PSA rose and he asked me to come back four weeks later and had risen again. And then he decided, okay, you got to go see a specialist, which I did. Then later that year towards the end of that year, the December time frame, I got biopsies done, which was a journey in its own right, because although I got over 20 biopsies from the prostate, none of them were cancerous, but I ended up with sepsis and that brought me on a journey into numerous infections. But the great thing about getting the sepsis was I actually had aggressive cancer. So if I hadn\u2019t got sepsis, I would have thought it was okay and I could have ended up with stage four cancer. So it\u2019s the sepsis in a strange way that saved my life. How did that translation actually happen? The sepsis has actually led to that discovery, that diagnosis? Yeah, well, what happened then, when I went in, I ended up going to hospital for eleven days just before Christmas in 2016, and my PSA in July was at 9.5. It had gone up to ten, I think, or 10.5 within a four week period. Then by December it was up to 19.5. So they knew at that stage things were going in the wrong direction, you know, but look, listen, as you well know, men can have a PSA reading in the hundreds, and it still doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re going to have to get radical prostatectomy or anything. They can maybe be treated differently. It\u2019s only an indicator. It doesn\u2019t mean you definitely have cancer. It has to be followed up. Well, I would prefer to be followed up by an MRI and then targeted biopsy rather than a random biopsy like I had first, you know. So what happened then when you actually got the correct diagnosis? Actually, I ended up with a different consultant who very skilfully managed me. And it was only in hindsight and reflection, I realised just what he was doing and he was managing really my expectations, my concerns and my worries. And he gave me an in depth talk about what the prostate was all about, how bad the cancer was and the options that were open to me. So there were some options that weren\u2019t and there were some options that were. And then the ones that were open to me, he made sure I went and visited each individual specialist consultant to talk about those options. And which option did you ultimately choose? Yeah, I ended up getting robotic radical prostatectomy. Actually, just the consultant who was managing me, he didn\u2019t do it. He did keyhole or he did open surgery, but he didn\u2019t do robotic surgery. So he referred me to his colleague who was just a couple of doors down from his office. And I got, I think it was six hour surgery or something I was in there for. It went extremely well, the surgery. I got it done in the afternoon. And the following morning they had me up out of bed and in the shower. Of course, me being the man that I am thinking I can\u2019t move, I\u2019ve just had major surgery, but I had this this lovely lady, I called her Maid Marion. She was a lady that looked to me as if she was in her sixties, she was like a health care worker. She wasn\u2019t a nurse. And she just said, I\u2019m here to get you into the shower this morning. And sure enough, she got me in the shower. She hosed me down. She looked after me so well. And I suppose you\u2019re worried you\u2019ve got tubes coming out of you everywhere and you\u2019re worried they are going to fall out or something. But she really looked after me well. So I mean, then the following day, then I was home. The surgeon did his job, and that\u2019s the thing I think about and not just prostate cancer, any major illness, cancer, in particular, having seen so many people have different forms of cancer. The surgeons do a wonderful job. They get you better. They hopefully get the cancer out or they get rid of it for a period of time. But then you\u2019re sort of left with the side effects thereafter. So for me, that translated into permanent incontinence and permanent erectile dysfunction. So they were two things that I had to get my head around, get used to it. I remember saying to the nurse at the very early stages, you have a bag on you for a week and then you go in after a week of surgery and then they remove the bag from you and they lay you down on a table and they say, breath in and they take the bag off. And then they say, no, get up very slowly because you may leak when you get up and of course they give you some pads or whatever to wear as you\u2019re getting up. But I think on my second visit to that urology nurse I said, please stop calling it leakage. I was expecting a drip. I had a tsunami. Now I was just unfortunate. I ended up for just over three months having to wear full nappies because my bladder just lost all control. So I was filling about anything between five and seven nappies a day. But the wonderful thing was once I lay down in bed in the evening, I have no leak whatsoever. It did help that at least I got comfort when I went to bed at night, you know. So Ray, you\u2019ve been through, gosh, sepsis and then you had erectile dysfunction and the incontinence. How has this experience inspired you to write? I guess what it all started off with, was when I got the diagnosis. I got it on a Friday, I think. And that Sunday, I just sat front of my computer and started typing. I didn\u2019t know what I was typing. I was just typing. It was a dialogue. It ended up being a dialogue about two voices in my head, sort of sitting back and reviewing everything that was happening to me in a very\u2026 I call it sort of like the non PC book about PC because it\u2019s just pure dialogue, you know, in it before. Would you have described yourself as a writer prior to this? No, not really. Okay. And it\u2019s just something that\u2026 I\u2019ll read you an extract from the two. So basically, it\u2019s two voices, and it\u2019s written very much in the sense of two Dublin lads having a conversation about me and I\u2019m a third party, and they\u2019re just totally disregard for any of my feelings or anything. Does it take place in the pub, Ray? Nope. It just takes place in my the wherever my head is. I remember saying to one guy, if we can only get them to show up now I\u2019d be happy because every time I would sit down and do something, I get, oh, there\u2019s another I should write about that. And I should do that. So actually, the book, it\u2019s called \u201cTaking the piss out of cancer\u201d. It actually spanned nearly two years, which was never the intention. I only intended it to span about six months, and actually I ended up finishing it\u2026 My dad during the book, at the end of it, he passed away. They even talk about him as well, passing away and how that impacted on me. It\u2019s just one of those things in life. I mean, that\u2019s what life is about. Indeed so let\u2019s hear the passage that you\u2019d like to share. Okay, so I\u2019ve been visiting a nurse. So one of the things they do is you visit a nurse. In my instance, I visited a nurse because of erectile dysfunction. They give you various options and to see if they can cure this erectile dysfunction. One of them. I just nickname this Nurse Jackie and it says: \u201cWell, Nurse Jackie says the pill won\u2019t work, but you can get a pump. Then the Mrs chirps up. Yes, love. I read about them. You can get them online. No fricking way. Hold it there. Nurse Jackie jumps in and says, no, you can\u2019t buy these online. She asked, have you met Rodrigo? He deals with this aspect, but here\u2019s a sample of what it looks like. Jesus, what did it look like? A fecking elephant semen collector. Oh go on, will you? We\u2019ll wait for it. Nurse Jackie then says they have to be custom made and Rodrigo will measure you for it. No way. And he says, do they come in extra small? Ah, Jesus, what\u2019s next? Now get this, she said, were you told it may get smaller after the operation as they have to move things about? Ah, jeez, this just keeps getting better. Was he on the floor at this stage? He just burst out laughing. Then he said he might as well become a lady boy if things get much worse. Mrs. asked, was there anything else they could try? Quick, tell me because I think mine is just retreated up inside me at this stage. Calm as you like Nurse Jackie says, you can always use the injection. What? Yeah, you can use an injection into your prick to enlarge it. Your man\u2019s Missus says, won\u2019t that hurt? As quick as anything Nurse Jackie jumps in and says, no, it\u2019s just a small prick. No way. Best bet, your man says, how do you know I have a small prick? And then they all just burst out laughing.\u201d And that\u2019s\u2026 I wrote it in a style of totally not politically correct. They didn\u2019t care what they said about you because you can either hedge around it or you can hit it face on. And I think when you have radical prostatectomy surgery, you\u2019re being hit face on. There is no cotton wool put around you. Your things are going to happen whether\u2026 I mean, I was just unfortunate. I don\u2019t want anybody listening to this thinking they\u2019re going to end up with permanent erectile dysfunction and permanent incontinence and all that type of thing. It doesn\u2019t happen to everyone. It happens to some and I was just one of the unlucky ones that it happened to, you know. One of the things that I also did was, it took away libido totally. It just isn\u2019t there. And I said to her, as difficult as that is that\u2019s actually a good thing, because could you imagine having erectile dysfunction and not having a low libido? I mean, that would just be, would just be, you know, that would be a curse on everything. As you say, nothing so bad that it couldn\u2019t be worse, right? She just looked at me and said, Well, it\u2019s you that it hasn\u2019t got the libido. I still have mine. So Ray, your writing really does provide\u2026 Because I\u2019ve seen you on Twitter and you\u2019re a big social media blogger, and developed quite a following, and I can see that it provides support and comfort, certainly humour to many men. And here\u2019s the point which they often find sorely lacking in their care. So I\u2019m wondering what you\u2019ve learned through their reactions to your writing.When I went on Twitter and I started posting and hashtagging, it suddenly\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t say people coming out of the woodwork. But suddenly men started following me. But the one thing when people meet me and I talk about it, it does take them back a bit because I don\u2019t hide the fact\u2026 They are things that happen in your life that aren\u2019t anything to do with something that you haven\u2019t done or that you have done, they just happen to you. And when things happen to you, it\u2019s not your fault. And there\u2019s no shame in that. The fact that I\u2019ve ended up with incontinence and with permanent erectile dysfunction, that just happened to me. There was nothing I did that made that happen to me. I looked after myself. I wasn\u2019t grossly overweight. I was relatively fit. I had a good diet. I never smoked or drank ever in my life. I never took any form of recreational drugs in my life. So I lived quite a good lifestyle. But, you know, these things happen and it\u2019s just one of those things. And when I meet people, I explain to them now and I won\u2019t be behind the door about it. I\u2019ll just say it straight out as it is. And some people find that very refreshing. Some people are a bit taken back with it, and inevitably they get used it. And then they sort of say to me, now, I\u2019m glad you talk like that. It helps me not feel so bad when I talk about it, because let\u2019s be honest about it. Men are not the best people at talking about anything that happens below their belly button, you know. I have two daughters. I never had sons in our house. So it\u2019s always been women. It\u2019s my wife, my two daughters, and then I was a real Irish man because I was a real Mummy\u2019s boy. My mother was my world to me. And you know, when you look at their journey and when you look at the journey of an individual who is born with a womb, they encounter things much earlier in life, like they have the menstrual cycle, very young in life. They have end up going to the doctors very young in life for checks and smear tests and everything. Men, we don\u2019t encounter that until something like prostate cancer hits upon us generally. Yes, that\u2019s really, really important. In fact, one of the things I\u2019ve definitely observed in some of the interactions I\u2019ve seen with you and your followers is this idea that prostate cancer brings so many taboos and misunderstandings about the male body and its functions. And you\u2019ve attempted to break through these with both your writing and your advocacy. And I\u2019m wondering if you can give some examples of how this has helped some of the men you work with. And then I guess I\u2019m interested in knowing how you think we can actually accelerate this process of better understanding, better acceptance, earlier engagement. Well, I think the way it\u2019s helped the men is we\u2019ve actually talked about it. We actually have a WhatsApp group going at the moment. There\u2019s a good few men in it and actually they\u2019re from Ireland, the UK and the US and Canada. And it was purely through interaction on social media we came about and we started talking about it and it breaks down that barrier. Like I\u2019ve had men phone me who are going in for the surgery because and here\u2019s the strange thing, I have more women following me than I have men and have more women direct messaging me, asking me questions about prostate cancer than I do men. On behalf of their partners, you mean? Exactly. It could be their partner, it could be their father, it could be their grandfather or sibling, whatever, friend, whatever, you know. And some of them have actually bought the books to give us presents to their, whoever is going on that journey to try and help them with that. The main reason behind the books. Well, there\u2019s two main reasons. The one is to raise awareness around prostate cancer, break down the language and the vocabulary that we use when we\u2019re talking about prostate cancer. And the other thing is both books, and I\u2019m finishing a third one at the moment on poetry, I don\u2019t take any money. I donate them fully to charity. So whenever somebody buys, the money just all goes to charity. But, I mean, we can say words are very powerful. It\u2019s like a number of people who have gone on the prostate cancer journey when they first of all, they tell someone they have cancer and there\u2019s a lot of sympathy. And this is something that we\u2019ve all found. And then they mentioned they have prostate cancer. And it\u2019s almost like the sympathy is turned off on the person who\u2019s talking to them because they say things like aren\u2019t you the lucky one that it was just prostate cancer or aren\u2019t you glad it was just that. And it really frustrates and upset them because they think, well hold on a minute, you\u2019ve no comprehension what we\u2019re actually going through, particularly those\u2026 I mean, I know, look I know guys were terminally ill. I know one guy, he was only 46 when he was diagnosed terminally ill. I read about another guy there, he was 36 when he was diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer. I grew up thinking, yeah, prostate cancer when I\u2019m seventy, I\u2019ll have a look at it, you know. But it was 53 when it came visiting me. And there are so many younger men. And for me, one of the things that happened was I was sexually abused as a child and that revisited me after my prostate cancer examinations and everything. And one of the things I try to raise awareness about when a child has been sexually abused. People often say, Why does someone wait till they\u2019re 50 or 40 to announce they were sexually abused? The reason any individual does that is because as a child, you don\u2019t have the vocabulary to explain what\u2019s happened to you. You\u2019ve been told by the perpetrator that it\u2019s a secret between you and them, or it\u2019s someone in society that nobody would believe would do it to you. Now, if you move forward ten or 40 years when you\u2019re an adult and you\u2019re 50 years of age like I was and you get prostate cancer and you look at that. The vocabulary and the language you need to talk about prostate cancer to another person is something men aren\u2019t that familiar with. I mean, how many men do you see sitting down at the pub talking about erectile dysfunction or how many of them will say, Gee, you know what strange thing happened to me last night, I had blood in my semen when I ejaculated. It\u2019s very true, women do talk about that more. I know you and I have talked about that before. Do you have another passage to read for us? Yeah, sure. I mean, this passage is from the other book, \u2018Nothing So Bad That It Couldn\u2019t Be Worse\u2019. This is strange encounter, because what happened with this book was, \u2018Taking the Piss Out of Cancer\u2019 I wrote first, and when I gave it to the publisher, they said, no, you better write an introduction to this. So I did. And then when I wrote the introduction, they said, no, can you just leave \u2018Taking the Piss Out of Cancer\u2019 to one side and write an entire book in the way you\u2019ve written the introduction because we really like that descriptive passage. So there\u2019s a section in it that I try to explain. You know, I\u2019ll read it anyway. I\u2019ll explain it then. So it just reads. \u201cBut this book is not simply about my childhood and the journey into adulthood. It is about an unfinished life and the evolution of me as a person. All these episodes that happened throughout my life are threads in the fabric that make me and their interwoven experiences formulate how I approach things in life, especially my journey with cancer. We are complex creatures and to simplify who we are does a disservice to us. To understand anyone fully you first must understand their journey, their encounters, challenges, failures and successes they have.\u201d And I believe that the way I approached my prostate cancer and probably the reason I\u2019m so outspoken about it, and I don\u2019t care what I say is because I was silenced as a child when I was sexually abused. I didn\u2019t have the language. And what I\u2019ve sort of said to myself is, you\u2019re not going to be silenced now. You\u2019ve had another traumatic experience in your life, and you\u2019re going to share that journey with others. And you\u2019re going to help others because you know as well as I do over 11,000 men die from prostate cancer in the UK every year. That\u2019s a staggering\u2026 We don\u2019t have the numbers for Ireland, but that\u2019s a staggering staggering amount. And the amount of men in America as well that are dying. And they don\u2019t know why. If you\u2019re a Caucasian male, you have a one in eight chance, if you\u2019re a black male, a one in four chance. Why? No one knows why. If your mother had breast cancer, you have a higher risk of getting prostate cancer. Figure. So I also feel at times that the medical profession or general practitioners who we go for, who\u2019s our front line that we go to. They sometimes don\u2019t always think of prostate cancer for younger men because that\u2019s the common thread I found with younger men that I talked to. I know I\u2019m been very generous to myself, calling myself young at 50. But it\u2019s not the first thing in their head. If you\u2019re having low libido, if you having a problem getting an erection, well usually, let\u2019s give you one of those stiffening pills, that should help you. They very rarely will say, well, let\u2019s get a PSA test done. Yeah, that\u2019s a massive challenge for most men. Most of the people I talk to, have found that to be the starting point that was hardest to achieve. And that\u2019s where language comes in. And that\u2019s where telling your story comes in. And that\u2019s where propping up all the other men who are on this journey comes in. Indeed, anyone even a transgender woman, because they still after prostate and helping them. So when they do go to their GP, they turn around and say, I have X Y and Z, do you think it might be prostate cancer? Do you think I should get a PSA test?  Exactly. Because I won\u2019t be offered to you when you turn 50 unless you ask for it. So the power of words that you\u2019re helping to provide, I think, really does give lots of strength and lots of confidence to these men. So on that note, can we finish with another passage from\u2026 Your choice whether it\u2019s the first or second books. Sure, I\u2019ll finish with a small poem that I wrote in \u2018Nothing So Bad That It Couldn\u2019t Be Worse\u2019. It\u2019ll actually be inserted in the book of poetry that I\u2019ve written now which will be called \u2018The Dark Side of Silence\u2019. That book will be out later this year. But this poem is called \u201cWhat if?\u201d I do 90% of my writing under the light of the moon because that\u2019s when my brain gets most active on these things. And there\u2019s a stillness in the air and in the environment and everything seems to be asleep but me. And it gives me time to go to places that probably I wouldn\u2019t during the day because I\u2019m too busy and there\u2019s so much going on. But this poem is called \u201cWhat if?\u201d: \u201cWhat if I screamed my silent cries aloud? Would you think me mad? What if I gave up? Would you think me sad? What if I didn\u2019t exist? Would you miss me? What if I asked for a hug? Would you think me needy? What if I was just me and would you still love me? What if I never spoke my fears? Would you think me brave? What if I said how I truly feel? Would you listen? What if I ask for forgiveness? Would you forgive me? What if it has all never happened?\u201d That\u2019s it.
