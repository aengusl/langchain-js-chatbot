{"pageContent": "Introduction: Adequate monitoring of volume and location of affected tissue might provide helpful information when performing localized ablative therapy for prostate cancer. We hypothesize that the change in blood flow patterns after therapy in comparison to the blood flow pattern prior to therapy can be used to locate and quantify the amount of affected tissue due to the therapy. We describe the use of three-dimensional contrast-enhanced power Doppler ultrasound (3D-CE-PDU) to determine its additive value to visualize the extent of tissue defects created by high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in correlation with the histopathology of the prostatectomy specimen.", "metaData": {"source": "A comparison of time taken to return to baseline erectile function following focal and whole gland ablative therapies for localized prostate cancer: A systematic review\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29277585/"}}
