{"pageContent": "Purpose of review: Through the prostate-specific antigen era, the proportion of men less than 55 years old with newly diagnosed prostate cancer more than doubled to almost 15%. As increasing numbers of men are living longer with prostate cancer, larger proportions will eventually present to our collective practices with rising prostate-specific antigen levels. Such prostate-specific antigen relapses, conservatively estimated to affect approximately 50 000 men each year, have become the most common form of advanced prostate cancer in the current period.", "metaData": {"source": "Comparison of quality of life following laparoscopic and open prostatectomy for prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12771715/"}}
