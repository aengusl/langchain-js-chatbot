{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies and among the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. It is a highly heterogeneous disease, ranging from remarkably slow progression or inertia to highly aggressive and fatal disease. As therapeutic decision-making, clinical trial design and outcome highly depend on the appropriate stratification of patients to risk groups, it is imperative to differentiate between benign versus more aggressive states. The incorporation of clinically valuable prognostic and predictive biomarkers is also potentially amenable in this process, in the timely prevention of metastatic disease and in the decision for therapy selection. This review summarizes the progress that has so far been made in the identification of the genomic events that can be used for the classification, prediction and prognostication of PCa, and as major targets for clinical intervention. We include an extensive list of emerging biomarkers for which there is enough preclinical evidence to suggest that they may constitute crucial targets for achieving significant advances in the management of the disease. Finally, we highlight the main challenges that are associated with the identification of clinically significant PCa biomarkers and recommend possible ways to overcome such limitations.", "metaData": {"source": "78Gy with Fiducial Marker Image-Guided Radiotherapy in Prostate Cancer: Single Center Analysis of 301 Patients\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27863019/"}}
