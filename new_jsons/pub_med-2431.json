{"pageContent": "Large numbers of Australian men are diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer each year. The incidence is exceeding mortality, and men are living longer with prostate cancer and the common treatment[s] side effect of impotence. Despite these epidemiological trends there is little research about men's experiences of impotence following treatment. An ethnographic study of Anglo-Australian men with localized prostate cancer explored participants' experiences of impotence following prostatectomy. In-depth semi-structured interviews with 15 men were analyzed using a social constructionist gendered framework. In particular, the effect of impotence on participants' masculinity, sexuality and intimate relationships was explored. The findings show that participants rationalized forgoing potency prior to surgery as a way of living longer. However, diverse complex reactions accompanied impotence. Whilst most participants redefined masculine ideals of phallocentric sex, the way in which this occurred varied greatly. The findings disrupt essentialist constructions of male sexuality and impotence, and provide valuable insight for clinical practice.", "metaData": {"source": "Evaluation of long-term living conditions in patients treated for localised prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32969128/"}}
