{"pageContent": "Background: Recent studies in prostatic tissue suggest that Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), a bacterium associated with acne that normally lives on the skin, is the most prevalent bacterium in the prostate and in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Its prevalence is higher in samples from patients subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer. The aim of our study was to test whether circulating levels of P. acnes antibodies are associated with prostate cancer risk and tumour characteristics using plasma samples from a population-based case-control study.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer and coronary heart disease: correlation or coincidence?\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15123400/"}}
