{"pageContent": "Improvement of quality of life (QoL) has become a major endpoint in clinical trials of patients with prostate cancer. However, there still exist considerable methodological problems regarding the development of optimal instruments and methods for presenting the results. Within the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) a core questionnaire is generally used for QoL evaluation, combined with a treatment- and disease-specific module. So far, no official EORTC prostate cancer module has been developed. Previous and ongoing trials in prostate cancer have addressed the following issues: for localised prostate cancer, micturition and sexuality, and for metastatic prostate cancer, bone pain, micturition, sexuality, vitality, hot flushes and gynaecomastia. The future challenge is to incorporate QoL results into the overall evaluation of treatment in combination with survival results and economical considerations.", "metaData": {"source": "Comment by E.
