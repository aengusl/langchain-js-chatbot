{"pageContent": " so today Dr Scholls were talking about quality of life which I know is a topic we're both very passionate about in fact it's the entire reason the pcri was created was the focus was not being put on quality of life when it came to their treatment decisions so when you found a pcri and you understood that the world of surgery was basically running all of prostate cancer what how did you bring quality of life to the table and what how do you why do you think it's so important of course it's a long history\n there was a time when all the experts including myself believed that every Cancer could spread and kill you and there was a time really when alternatives to surgery were terrible the radiation back in the late 90s was burning people and and didn't get the job done and created a mess there's been an evolution over the last two decades realizing a couple of things one that the that it is possible to treat prostate cancer now with other methods besides surgery and get the same or even better cure rates and\n have less harm as a result the other issue that we've discovered over the last 20 years is there's a lot many types of prostate cancer don't spread and can be safely watched or perhaps treated with a minimalistic focal Therapies so so those two things have allowed us to intervene now with a much more measured approach than what we used in the past where it was it's cancer your life is in danger cut it out immediately whereas now it's an issue of well let's figure out what type of cancer it is and let's look at at the\n many options that we have to try and finesse the situation so that you're able to sidestep some of the common and serious side effects of surgery such as incontinence and sexual impotence one of the issues that we encounter when we're on helpline and we're talking to a patient who's newly diagnosed is the concept of time a lot of patients think that they don't have enough time to make the right decision and focus on their quality of life because it's cancer and isn't cancer fast growing and we need to\n get it out and they said it's maybe a Gleason 8 9 10. I'm scared what would you say to that I'd say that's the main struggle that I have is trying to help people recalibrate in terms of how imminent this whole prostate cancer situation is if you think of all the other cancers the lungs and the bone Cancers and the Brain cancers they are emergencies almost and you want to act quickly and eradicate them and hopefully before they spread prostate cancer spreads very slowly when it does spread and in many cases doesn't\n spread at all I mean people have asked should we really be calling this cancer maybe this is sort of a prostate growth not really a cancer my old writing partner Ralph Blum came up said we should call it the uncancer as they had an advertising program for you know Coca-Cola and 7UP was calling themselves the uncola and so maybe we'll call prostate cancer the uncancer anything you can do to shift this away from the idea of cancer and how imminent the the need is for treatment and allow people to to think about it\n more and I think there's another issue uh that comes up in this whole process of quality of life versus risk of death and trying to weigh those two things and that has to do with the process of thinking through the complexities of prostate cancer there's a lot of moving parts to this whole process and not everyone wants to do that some people just want to delegate it to someone in a white coat tell me what to do Doc and uh and I'll I'll just follow through you're the expert don't don't confuse me with the details\n it's an arduous process I mean we go on and on in these videos and we haven't exhausted the topic of prostate cancer it's a huge topic and there is so much information and it's it's not like yes or no this is relational information where well this means this in this context but in this context it changes so so you have to use the knowledge in context of the type of cancer the age of the patient the specific quality of life goals that every individual has I think what you want to emphasize is that the\n um the idea of all prostate cancer is dangerous and life-threatening and therefore requires a pedal to the metal approach is incorrect thinking for prostate cancer correct thinking for other cancers incorrect thinking for prostate cancer I think one of the biggest topics we talk about in pcri is active surveillance so can you explain how many prostate cancer patients statistically are like a Gleason 6 where they don't have to go to immediate treatment so about 50 percent of men diagnosed every year uh in the United\n States which is approaches 200 000 cases a year of those about a hundred thousand are Gleason six and do have zero metastatic potential you say well how ethically can any doctor suggest treatment well just the hearing the word cancer is say well you don't have it now but you might get it later or your biopsy might have missed something high grade so this whole issue of cancer and fear is in the air so people are motivated to jump in and do a preventative treatment against the possibility of the cancer becoming a\n problem someday and you know the industry is is not designed to talk you out of treatment the industry exists to treat people and there are people that do need treatment that's completely Justified so it's uh it's a it's a problematic situation if the patients don't take the bull by the horns and and say I'm going to commit to understanding what's really going on here they're going to get swept along in the emotion and the and the the way the industry is just sort of predisposed to treat people sometimes\n it'll be the right treatment sometimes it won't so like you said when it comes to the medical industry not being designed to focus on quality of life there you're in there you know they're focusing on treatment why is that the case why are doctors not focused on quality of life can you go into more in depth of why that is in some ways they're diametrically opposed so the the best quality of life in terms of function urinary and sexual functions to have no treatment at all so there's always going to be a trade-off\n and this trying to balance the trade-off of the risk of the cancer being a problem someday in the by and by and the immediate side effects of treatment is an equation that requires some depth of understanding of what's really going on and that takes time and it's not a very pleasant journey you know talking to different experts some who have one agenda another has a different agenda it can be painful the you know there's a lot of resources the pcri of course offers those resources there's support\n groups out there talking to you know doctors who don't have a direct connection to doing one particular type of treatment that can be helpful but what makes it more difficult is the industry is changing so quickly there's tremendous amounts of new technology and it's hard for the doctors to keep up with the latest latest methodologies so if you have a patient who maybe they've had a urologist for quite some time and they're newly diagnosed they really like this doctor but he's not focusing on\n their quality of life how do they approach that topic with them do they just get another doctor or do you think that they should bring up their quality of life and try to talk to other out talk about other outcomes well a lot of times this is in the context of making a decision about treatment so the big moments of decision are am I going to get treatment I'm going to pursue active surveillance or am I going to undergo some form of therapy that's probably the biggest first question in my opinion all\n three plus threes can be watched and there's certain favorable types of three plus fours that can be watched and then as men get older uh you know into their 80s you can watch four plus threes and four plus fours the number one issue is should I treat it at all and then if the risk appears excessive for watching it and the decision is arrived at that yes we should treat it then that's a new Arena of K now why what kind of treatment do I need what will offer optimal cure rates with minimal side effects and a lot of people just jump to\n point two and they just figure that it's cancer it needs to be treated so there's a first step does it really need to be treated because at least half of the men diagnosed every year can be watched but then if we do have a type of cancer that should be treated because of the risk of spread then it's an involved process many people are familiar with of talking to surgeons and radiation therapists and and focal therapists and trying to shop around and find out which one will be the most which one will fit your quality of life\n goals and after the best cure rates no it makes a lot of sense because I think that that over and over again the number one thing I see is that patients have to Champion their own quality of life at every juncture whether that's at the beginning of treatment whether that's in the middle of treatment afterwards because there's such a short amount of time that they're meeting with their Physicians you know the physician doesn't have time for the quality of life conversation maybe the nurse\n honestly it's really up to the patient to focus on that and to fight for that so it sounds like what you're saying it sounds like between choosing the doctor taking time to make the right decision doing the right research whether that's pcri videos other advocacy group support groups websites and doing their own research that is one of the only ways that they can really promote quality of life in their lives thank you so much for watching this video on quality of life we're honored to be here for you\n but I want to bring up a couple things that I hope you remember number one you have time I know that cancer is a very scary situation but you do have time to make the right decisions also remember get a second opinion I know it may seem a little bit cumbersome but lots of opinions can help lead the direction of where you want to go with your life and your treatment decision and the third thing is to remember it really is all up to you your doctors may be strongly suggesting something but you're the one who's going to be able to make the best\n decision with all the research you do and weighing all of your options and your options are the most important thing to us so we're honored to be here for you don't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel we come out with new videos every week and visit our website pcri.\n org we're honored to be here for you [Music] thank you\nSUMMARY \nQuality of life is the main focus of the PCRI (Prostate Cancer Research Institute).\nTreatment options for prostate cancer have evolved to include less invasive options with the same or better cure rates.\nProstate cancer spreads slowly and in many cases, does not spread at all.\nAbout 50% of men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the US have Gleason 6 and zero metastatic potential and can be safely watched without treatment.\nPatients need to champion their own quality of life by taking time to make the right decision, getting a second opinion, and doing their own research.", "metaData": {"source": "Why Quality of Life Matters | #ProstateCancer | #MarkScholzMD | PCRI - YouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWTzgVibR_M"}}
