{"pageContent": "Purpose: High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) provides a non-invasive salvage treatment option for patients with recurrence after external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). As part of EBRT the prostate is frequently implanted with permanent fiducial markers. To date, the impact of these markers on subsequent HIFU treatment is unknown. The objective of this work was to systematically investigate, using computational simulations, how these fiducial markers affect the delivery of HIFU treatment.", "metaData": {"source": "Oncologic and Functional Outcomes of Partial Gland Ablation with High Intensity Focused Ultrasound for Localized Prostate Cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30577402/"}}
