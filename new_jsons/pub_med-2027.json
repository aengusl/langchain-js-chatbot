{"pageContent": "Pathologic fractures, spinal compression, and pain take a great toll on the healthcare costs and well-being of men with prostate cancer metastatic to the bone. For almost 10 years, the only drug proven to prevent these skeletal-related adverse events was the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid. In a study published by Fizazi et al. in The Lancet, the monoclonal antibody to RANKL, denosumab, is shown to be superior to zoledronic acid in the prevention of these events. The only notable adverse event more frequent in either arm was increased hypocalcemia in the denosumab arm. There was a greater frequency of osteonecrosis of the jaw in the denosumab treatment group that did not reach statistical significance, but is of great concern. While further analysis is needed to determine the value of denosumab in preventing adverse events and improving quality of life, this new therapy is a significant addition to the treatment of men living with metastatic prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Effect of erectile dysfunction following prostate cancer treatment\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26576913/"}}
