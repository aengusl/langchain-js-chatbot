{"pageContent": "The Notch signalling pathway plays a fundamental role in tissue development due to its involvement in cell fate determination and postnatal tissue differentiation. Its capacity to regulate cell growth and development has been linked to the occurrence of several cancers including that of the prostate. The transmembrane receptor Notch-1 of this pathway has been linked to the oncogenic role of Notch signalling in prostate adenocarcinoma. Other studies have suggested a tumour suppressive function for Notch-1. This review focuses on the role of Notch-1 in prostate cancer development and maintenance and relates this to the fundamental role of Notch in normal prostate development. The current understanding of the aberrant Notch signalling characteristic of prostate cancer is discussed, and recent therapeutic advances in this field are presented.", "metaData": {"source": "The natural history of locally confined prostate cancer: a review\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1574462/"}}
