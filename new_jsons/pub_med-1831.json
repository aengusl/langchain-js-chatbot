{"pageContent": "In an attempt to determine the role of environmental factors in the etiology of prostate cancer, we compared the clinical-pathological findings of prostate cancer among Japanese Americans in Hawaii and Japanese living in Japan. Our study showed that prostate cancer in Japanese living in Japan is more advanced than in Japanese Americans. The findings indicate that screening for prostate cancer in Japan is far behind that in the USA. The difference in level of cancer screening also precluded our attempt to analyse environmental factors contributing to prostate cancer progression in the two groups. The variation in method of clinical detection of prostate cancer between the USA and Japan is also likely to contribute to the apparent difference in the incidence of the disease.", "metaData": {"source": "Living Longer and Better with Advanced Prostate Cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32553618/"}}
