{"pageContent": "Objective: To review the literature on racial variation in the pattern of care (PoC) and quality of care (QoC) for prostate cancer, as there are known racial disparities in the incidence and outcomes of prostate cancer. While there are some biological explanations for these differences, they do not completely explain the variation. Differences in the appropriateness and QoC delivered to men of different racial groups may contribute to disparities in outcome.", "metaData": {"source": "Future directions for precision oncology in prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35657153/"}}
