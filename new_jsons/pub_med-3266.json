{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is a common cancer in men, but variable clinical behaviors make its management challenging. Risk stratification is a key issue in disease management. Patient-tailored strategies are strongly advocated to reduce unnecessary treatment while maximizing the oncological outcomes of patient who need active treatment in the primary, adjuvant or salvage setting. Recently, tissue-based biomarkers or genomic tests have become available to improve the clinical decision-making. Areas covered: In this review, the authors present recent evidence about these tissue-based biomarkers, discussing the application of each of them in the clinical setting, focusing on the tests aimed to provide a better risk stratification and to guide decision-making after the diagnosis of PCa (i.e. OncotypeDX\u24c7, Prolaris\u24c7, ProMark\u24c7, Ki-67, Decipher\u24c7, PTEN, PORTOS, AR-V7 and DNA repair gene mutations). Expert commentary: Even if the clinicopathologic features are still the most frequently-used predictors of disease progression, these tools can be helpful in decision-making at every stage of the PCa management. Actually, OncotypeDX\u24c7, Prolaris\u24c7 and Decipher\u24c7 are recommended in the clinical setting by guidelines at different steps of PCa management. Consequently, further studies are indispensable to better tailor the right therapy for the right patient and at the right time.", "metaData": {"source": "Circulating endothelial cells as biomarkers of prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18682720/"}}
