It is part of the male reproductive system.\n\u2022 A healthy prostate is about the size of a walnut and has a \nvolume of 15-25 millilitres (ml)\nWhat is prostate cancer?\nProstate cancer is an abnormal cell growth in the prostate \nthat can spread uncontrollably into surrounding tissues and \nto other parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymph \nnodes.\nIn 2018 more than 450,000 new prostate cancer cases were \ndiagnosed and  over 100,000 men died of prostate cancer \nin Europe.  Prostate cancer-related deaths are among the \ntop three of cancer deaths for men. In recent years prostate \ncancer related deaths are rising again despite the existence \nof screening methods. That is why the EAU recommends PSA \n(Prostate Specific Antigen) testing for the early detection of \nprostate cancer.Unless it is far advanced, prostate cancer shows no clear \nsymptoms (asymptomatic) and men are normally not aware it \nhas developed. \nIf the disease is not discovered and diagnosed in its early \nstages, men can develop symptoms such as bone pain due to \nthe cancer spreading.\nEarly detection is aimed at finding this asymptomatic cancer \nin an early stage where it can still be cured and stopped from \nmoving to an advanced stage.\nWhat is PSA?\nProstate-specific antigen, or PSA, is a protein produced by the \nprostate gland that is present in the male\u2019s blood. PSA levels \nrise when there is a benign enlargement of the prostate, or an \ninfection of the prostate, also known as prostatitis, or prostate \ncancer.\nWho should get tested?\nProstate cancer early detection should be offered to healthy \nand well informed men over the age of 50 and men over 45 \nyears of age, who have a known family history for prostate \ncancer or are of African descent. \nSometimes, depending on your personal situation, there are \nreasons not to be tested.\nTalk to your family doctor about the pros and cons of prostate \ncancer early detection before you decide whether to be tested \nor re-tested, especially if you have other health concerns. \nHow is testing done?\nTesting should always involve:\n\u2022 PSA testing (blood test)\n\u2022 Digital rectal examination (DRE)\nA digital rectal examination is used to check the prostate for \nany abnormalities. It involves a healthcare provider feeling the \nprostate by inserting a finger into the rectum (Fig. 2).\nPSA testing is one of the most often used tools to diagnose \nprostate conditions. The PSA-level is determined by a blood \nsample to test the risk of prostate cancer. Depending on the PSA Testing\nFig. 1: Pathway of sperm. \u00a92020 patients.uroweb ALL RIGHTS RESERVED\nUreter\nSeminal vesicle\nEjaculatory duct\nProstatic urethra\nProstate glandBladder\nVas deferens\nTesticlesEpididymisUrethra- 4 -\nPSA-level (normal or elevated) further testing may not have to \nhappen or, more testing may be needed. \nIf your PSA is too high or if the digital rectal examination feels \nabnormal, it may mean you are at risk of having prostate \ncancer. Together with your healthcare professional and \naccording to your risk and medical history, the next step may \nbe:\n\u2022 to repeat the PSA test to make sure the elevated level is \nnot temporarily e.g. caused by an inflammation \n\u2022 to use a risk prediction tool which, on the basis of more \ninformation, such as  your age and size of the prostate \n(next to the digital rectal examination and the PSA test),  \ncalculates your personal risk of having prostate cancer \n\u2022 to perform an MRI of the prostate which produces a \ndetailed image of your prostate, enabling your doctor to \nsee if there are any potential suspicious areas \nIf considered needed, these exams might lead to a prostate \nbiopsy. A biopsy involves taking samples of the prostate with a \nneedle to look at under a microscope. The tissue is looked at \nto see if it has cancer and if so, how aggressive it is. \nI feel healthy, why should I be tested? \nPSA testing involves a simple blood test, your health insurance \nor national health service will normally cover the costs and \nit can be done by your family doctor or urologist. It will \nshow if you are at risk of getting prostate cancer and is the \nonly way for finding it early. Based on your personal risk and \nother conditions you may have, you can determine an early \ndetection strategy/interval together with your family doctor. \nThis means that you are tested at set times. Are there other reasons for the  \nPSA value to be elevated? \nYes. The PSA value that is found in your blood, is a single \ncurrent view of your PSA level. Any form of prostate irritation \ncan cause test values to be high. Benign, or non-cancerous \nenlargement of the prostate, a lower urinary tract infection or \nprostate irritation (sports, intercourse, urinary catheter) may \nlead to PSA elevation. Earlier values, medical history and risk \nfactors are therefore important when thinking about retesting \nor further diagnostics. \nBenefits\n\u2022 A PSA test may help find prostate cancer at an early stage. \nCancer is easier to treat and is much better managed if it \nis found in its early stages.\n\u2022 It will also let you know if you are at risk of getting \nprostate cancer in the future.\nLimitations\n\u2022 A PSA level that is high does not always mean that you \nhave prostate cancer (a false-positive result).  Other \nconditions you may have can raise PSA levels such as an \nenlarged prostate or a prostate infection\n\u2022 In few cases, the PSA level may be low even though \ncancer is present (a false negative result)\n\u2022 PSA testing may find a cancer that would never have given \nsymptoms. This is referred to as over-diagnosis: finding a \ncancer that is not likely to cause poor health or to present \na risk to a man\u2019s life\nPotential risks of PSA testing \nBecause of its limitations, PSA testing can possibly lead \nto unnecessary further testing (such as a biopsy) which, if \nprostate cancer is found, might then lead to overtreatment  \n(such as an operation or radiation therapy). Many (40%) of the \ntumours would not end up causing major health problems. \nFollow-up of these tumours is advised. This may lead to \nanxiety and stress.\nBy not measuring your PSA, you will not risk false positive \nmeasurements and the resultant stress, retesting and biopsy, \nbut this might also cause the missing of an early (treatable \nand curable) cancer. Late detection might mean the cancer is \nfound at a more advanced stage with worse cure-rates.Fig. 2: digital rectal examination.\nProstateRectum\n \u00a92018 patients.uroweb ALL RIGHTS RESERVED- 5 -\nSummary\n\u2022 PSA testing helps finding prostate cancer at an early stage \nwhen it is more likely to be cured \n\u2022 Remember, not everyone with a high PSA level will have \na cancer and not everyone who is found to have a cancer \nwill need treatment\n\u2022 Talk to your family doctor about the risks and benefits and \nwhether this test is right for youEuropean Association of Urology\nPO Box 30016\nNL-6803 AA  ARNHEM\nThe Netherlands\ne-Mail: info.patientinformation@uroweb.org\nWebsite: patients.uroweb.org", "metaData": {"source": "EAU information on PSA testing (English):\nhttps://patients.uroweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/PSA-Testing_09-June-2020.pdf"}}
