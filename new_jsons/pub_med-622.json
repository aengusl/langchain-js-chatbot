{"pageContent": "Introduction: Algorithms for the treatment of prostate cancer (PrCa) rely on risk grouping, and those who fall into low (LR) and favourable intermediate risk (FIR) categories have multiple options for treatment. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HiFU) is a local treatment modality that uses ultrasound waves to ablate prostate cancer. In case of treatment failure, optimal salvage modality after HiFU remains unclear.", "metaData": {"source": "Salvage robotic prostatectomy following whole gland high-intensity focused ultrasound with a Sonablate 500 device: technical feasibility and safety\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27995543/"}}
