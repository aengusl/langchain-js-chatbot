{"pageContent": "Surgical prostate cancer (PCa) treatment delay (TD) may increase the likelihood of recurrence of disease, and influence quality of life as well as survival disparities between Black and White men. We used latent class analysis (LCA) to identify risk profiles in localized, malignant PCa surgical treatment delays while assessing co-occurring social determinants of health. Profiles were identified by age, marital status, race, county of residence (non-Appalachian or Appalachian), and health insurance type (none/self-pay, public, or private) reported in the Tennessee Department of Health cancer registry from 2005 to 2015 for adults \u226518 years (N = 18,088). We identified three risk profiles. The highest surgical delay profile (11% of the sample) with a 30% likelihood of delaying surgery >90 days were young Black men, <55 years old, living in a non-Appalachian county, and single/never married, with a high probability of having private health insurance. The medium surgical delay profile (46% of the sample) with a 21% likelihood of delay were 55-69 years old, White, married, and having private health insurance. The lowest surgical delay profile (42% of the sample) with a 14% likelihood of delay were \u226570 years with public health insurance as well as had a high probability of being White and married. We identified that even with health insurance coverage, Blacks living in non-Appalachian counties had the highest surgical delay, which was almost double that of Whites in the lowest delay profile. These disparities in PCa surgical delay may explain differences in health outcomes in Blacks who are most at-risk.", "metaData": {"source": "Dealing with a troublesome body: a qualitative interview study of men's experiences living with prostate cancer treated with endocrine therapy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21550304/"}}
