{"pageContent": "After local therapy for prostate cancer, presumably isolated nodal recurrence is being detected in increasing numbers of patients by modern imaging techniques, especially by positron emission tomography (PET). The question arises whether lymphadenectomy may delay tumor progression.Conclusions concerning the value of PET/computed tomography, perioperative complications, and oncological outcome were derived from available studies and our own experiences. Six studies reported on 83 patients who underwent lymphadenectomy for suspected nodal recurrence. In cases with histological confirmation, no patient was cured.Hence, nodal recurrence in prostate cancer most likely represents a systemic affection instead of locally limited disease. If a drop in the prostate-specific antigen level occurs after lymphadenectomy, it can be assumed that the progression-free period is expected to be less than 12 months.The available data on oncological outcomes of this procedure are insufficient. Therefore, lymphadenectomy for nodal recurrence of prostate cancer remains an unproven approach.", "metaData": {"source": "Clinical, pathological and molecular prognostic factors in prostate cancer decision-making process\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26917215/"}}
