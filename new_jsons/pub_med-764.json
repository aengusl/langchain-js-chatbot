{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in men. There are a number of treatment options for PC with a different therapeutic approach between USA and Europe. Radical prostatectomy is one of the most used therapies but focal gland therapy is an emerging approach, especially for localized tumors. In this scenario, high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been incorporated in certain medical association guidelines. HIFU has been employed for about 10 years especially for localized PC. Results are promising with a 5-year biochemical survival rate ranging from 45% to 84%. Collateral events are rare and HIFU retreatment is not common. Magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) was recently presented as a method for ablation with focused ultrasound under magnetic resonance imaging guidance. It has the advantage of improved targeting and real time temperature monitoring but only a few studies have been conducted with human patients. The aim of this review is to describe the current status of HIFU and MRgFUS in the therapy of PC.", "metaData": {"source": "Correlation of transrectal and transabodominal ultrasound measurement of transition zone volume with post-operative enucleated adenoma volume in benign prostatic hypertrophy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24876907/"}}
