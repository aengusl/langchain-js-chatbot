{"pageContent": "Several alterations of orgasmic function that occur after radical prostatectomy (RP) have never been assessed in robot-assisted RP (RARP) series. We sought to assess the prevalence and predictors of recovery from orgasm-associated incontinence (climacturia) and painful orgasm (PO) after RARP and open RP (ORP). Following surgery, sexually active patients who had undergone either RARP or ORP prospectively completed a 28-item questionnaire including sensitive issues regarding sexual function (eg, climacturia and PO). Rates of postoperative climacturia and PO were compared for RARP and ORP patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis was applied to assess estimated rates of recovery from either climacturia or PO after both procedures. Cox regression models tested predictors of recovery from those conditions. Overall, 221 (29.5%) of 749 patients reported climacturia, without differences between RARP and ORP. Conversely, PO was significantly more frequently reported after ORP than after RARP (46 [11.6%] vs 25 [7.1%] patients, respectively; p=0.04). At Kaplan-Meier analysis, recovery from climacturia over time was faster and greater after RARP than after ORP (8.5% vs 5%, respectively, at 24-mo assessment and 48% vs 15%, respectively, at 84-mo assessment; p<0.01). Conversely, no differences were found between groups in terms of postoperative recovery from PO. At multivariable analysis, only RARP achieved independent predictor status for recovery from climacturia after adjusting for other functional outcomes. Conversely, no variables were significantly associated with recovery from postoperative PO.", "metaData": {"source": "[Radical prostatectomy--the optimal surgical treatment]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22509666/"}}
