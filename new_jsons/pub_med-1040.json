{"pageContent": "Sexual function was evaluated in 34 patients with low-risk prostate cancer (PSA < or = 10, Gleason score < or = 6, clinical stage T1/T2) undergoing brachytherapy in a phase III prospective randomized trial comparing iodine-125 ((125)I) to palladium-103 ((103)Pd). The mean and median International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) scores for the entire group were 14.2 and 16.5, respectively, and there was no difference between these scores when stratified by isotope. IIEF scores < 6, 6 to 11, and > or = 12 were recorded in 35% (12/34), 6% (2/34), and 59% (20/34) of patients, respectively. Hematospermia, orgasmalgia (pain at the time of orgasm), and alteration in intensity of orgasm were documented in 26% (9/34), 15% (5/34), and 38% (13/34) of patients, respectively, but these side effects were of limited duration for most patients. There was no relationship between radiation dose to the neurovascular bundles (NVB), which averaged 209% of the prescribed prostate dose, and the development of postbrachytherapy impotence. All four impotent patients who used sildenafil responded favorably. With a median follow-up of 13 months, 65% of patients undergoing prostate brachytherapy maintained sexual function without pharmacologic support. Including sildenafil responses, 76.5% of patients sustained erections sufficient for sexual intercourse.", "metaData": {"source": "TrueNTH sexual recovery study protocol: a multi-institutional collaborative approach to developing and testing a web-based intervention for couples coping with the side-effects of prostate cancer treatment in a randomized controlled trial\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28969611/"}}
