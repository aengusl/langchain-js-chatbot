{"pageContent": "The incidence of prostate cancer (PCa) in men globally increases as the standard of living improves. Blood serum biomarker prostate-specific antigen (PSA) detection is the gold standard assay that do not meet the requirements of early detection. Herein, a solution-gated graphene transistor (SGGT) biosensor for the ultrasensitive and rapid quantification detection of the early prostate cancer-relevant biomarker, miRNA-21 is reported. The designed single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) probes immobilized on the Au gate can hybridize effectively with the miRNA-21 molecules targets and induce the Dirac voltage shifts of SGGT transfer curves. The limit of detection (LOD) of the sensor can reach 10-20 M without amplification and any chemical or biological labeling. The detection linear range is from 10-20 to 10-12 M. The sensor can realize real-time detection of the miRNA-21 molecules in less than 5 min and can well distinguish one-mismatched miRNA-21 molecule. The blood serum samples from the patients without RNA extraction and amplification are measured. The results demonstrated that the biosensor can well distinguish the cancer patients from the control group and has higher sensitivity (100%) than PSA detection (58.3%). Contrastingly, it can be found that the PSA level is not directly related to PCa.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer patients and their partners: differences in satisfaction indices and psychological variables\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17634055/"}}
