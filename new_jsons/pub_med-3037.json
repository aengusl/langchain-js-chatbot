{"pageContent": "Purpose of review: We created an inventory of current predictive tools available for prostate cancer. This review may serve as an initial step toward a comprehensive reference guide for physicians to locate published nomograms that apply to the clinical decision in question. Using MEDLINE a literature search was performed on prostate cancer predictive tools from January 1966 to November 2007. We describe the patient populations to which they apply and the outcomes predicted, and record their individual characteristics.", "metaData": {"source": "What matters to patients and clinicians when discussing the impact of cancer medicines on health-related quality of life?
