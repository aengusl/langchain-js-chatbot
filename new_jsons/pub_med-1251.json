{"pageContent": "The aim of this study was to compare health related quality of life (QoL) of patients with prostate cancer, who had undergone radical prostatectomy (RP), with patients who were carefully monitored. This prospective study included 56 patients who had undergone the radical prostatectomy (RP) and 48 non-operated patients (watchful waiting, WW). All patients filled EPIC questionnaire at baseline, 1th, 3rd, 6th and 12th month. At baseline, mean scores were similar in both groups, but one month after the surgery in RP group, patients had statistically significant lower score of urinary incontinency, urinary function and sexual function compared with WW patients. These scores were significantly higher in the 3rd, 6th and 12th month in operated patients, but there was no improvement in the WW group. Radical prostatectomy does not significantly improve quality of life. Prostatectomized patients had worse scores on the QoL scale, with exception of the urinary disturbance dimension.", "metaData": {"source": "Treatment regret and quality of life following radical prostatectomy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23907238/"}}
