Prostate cancer is now the most commonly diagnosed cancer amongst men in the UK. With this sombre fact comes a multitude of challenges and opportunities. I\u2019m Clare Delmar.\u00a0Joining me today is patient advocate and educator, Andrew Gabriel, who, through his own experience with prostate cancer and his advocacy work, has become a well known leader of patient support groups and a recognised source of knowledge on hormone therapy. His hugely popular talk called \u2018Surviving Hormone Therapy\u2018 has been attended by hundreds of patients and clinicians who value its honesty and its candour. Andrew is part of Prostate Cancer UK Patients as Educators programme, which supports clinicians in their patient engagement. Andrew, it\u2019s lovely to have you here today. Thank you so much for coming on OnFocus.Oh, hello, Clare. It\u2019s lovely to be here as well. I\u2019ve listened to many of your podcasts before. So it\u2019s really great to actually participate in one.Yeah, well, hopefully the first of many and you have so much to say about hormone therapy. So why don\u2019t we jump right in? And one of the things that we\u2019ve talked about before is about the use of hormone therapy during the pandemic. And I\u2019m wondering if you can comment on if it\u2019s increased or what you\u2019ve noticed. And do you think that the challenges that men face under the hormone treatment has actually been exacerbated during this period?It\u2019s a very interesting question. I perhaps ought to sort of explain for listeners who are not familiar with what hormone therapy does, you know, why it\u2019s used. So the prostate gland in men is required for fathering children and it produces some components of semen. Contrary to what many men sort of heading into prostate cancer treatment might imagine, it\u2019s not required for erections and it\u2019s not required for orgasm, although the erection nerves run around the outside of it, so some of the treatments, you have to be really careful and there is a risk to that mechanism. The prostate is activated by testosterone, which causes it to produce the semen contributions that it normally generates and causes it to grow. And most cases of prostate cancer are also driven by testosterone. So you can kind of switch off prostate cancer, at least temporarily, by switching off testosterone. And that\u2019s what hormone therapy does. So it basically switches off the testosterone temporarily while you\u2019re on the hormone therapy. In order to sort of think has the use of hormone therapy grown during this period of covid? It\u2019s kind of useful to think how it\u2019s used. So there is probably about four different reasons that it would be used in prostate cancer. So it\u2019s often used to shrink the prostate. If you\u2019re going to have a whole gland treatment, for example, external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy, it\u2019s useful if the prostate is not too big. Now you can use a narrow beam so it\u2019s less of the other organs or you can use fewer seeds in the brachytherapy. So patients are often put on hormone therapy for that purpose. That\u2019s probably not significantly changed. It improves radiotherapy outcomes also for the aggressive cancers. So that, again, is something that\u2019s probably similar. For incurable prostate cancer, it increases longevity, unfortunately, doesn\u2019t work forever, but it does give many men many years.Extra time. Yeah.Yeah. So it\u2019s important for that. But there is a new use for it, that\u2019s cropped up during the covid era.OKSo often it\u2019s not been possible to continue with diagnosis or to perform some treatments that were decided upon immediately because some facilities were not available, some staff were not available, operating theatres got turned into ICU, anaesthetists got taken off to be intubating covid patients. Lots of those things interfered with the normal running of hospitals. So what do you do with a man who\u2019s got prostate cancer and you\u2019re halfway through diagnosing, but you can\u2019t now do a biopsy or diagnose and he\u2019s chosen that he\u2019s going to have prostatectomy, but he can\u2019t have it because no operating theatre is available.Yeah.Well, you can put him on hormone therapy because the hormone therapy pauses the cancer at that point and it will pause it for long enough that you can, generally speaking, get through these temporary covid disruption.And did you see this happen?Oh, yes, that happened a lot. Now, there\u2019s probably one other effect, which I saw happen quite a bit, and that is some men who chose prostatectomy actually then discovered it wasn\u2019t available because going back to this problem, no operating theatres, no anaesthetists, because they\u2019re being used for other purposes and then switched choices and they might have switched then to external beam radiotherapy and that would normally come with hormone therapy. So there will have been some increased use of hormone therapy in that scenario. Some men had longer periods on hormone therapy before they started their radiotherapy than normal. That I don\u2019t think is an issue because actually getting your PSA down really low, which is what hormone therapy will do, for radiotherapy, has some advantages.Yes.But undoubtedly I don\u2019t think any figures would be available yet. And we haven\u2019t come out of covid interfering with treatments completely. But I suspect that there is a higher use of hormone therapy during this period, in terms of proportion. Now, of course, one sad fact here is that an awful lot of men have not gone to their GPs and got tested during this period. So in fact, the referrals for prostate cancer have dropped very significantly. And there are tens of thousands of men who haven\u2019t been referred who would normally have been referred. And that does translate to rather a lot of men who are walking around probably with high risk prostate cancer, who don\u2019t know, and are not diagnosed, who would normally have been diagnosed in the absence of covid.So, I mean, the first group when you mentioned about the possible increase in hormone therapy, and you mentioned two groups. You mentioned that the second group, which was those that might have elongated periods on hormone therapy while they were waiting for treatment or intervention not treatment, and then mentioned another group, which might be those that are put on hormone therapy, simply to pause during the period of their diagnosis and before treatment could become available. I mean, do you have any knowledge of that or any\u2026. I don\u2019t imagine you have any data. But do you have any knowledge at hand?Oh, yes. Plenty of patients in our support groups have experienced that, who were diagnosed during this period of covid.And were they counselled beforehand? Because, you know, I mean, something else that you talk a lot about is what the effects are, of course, of this therapy on the healthy mind and the healthy body.I think they were counselled to the extent that\u2026 I mean it wasn\u2019t compulsory, it was, would you like to do this? Because it was new. But no, as you\u2019ve heard me say before, men are not really counselled when they start on hormone therapy. That\u2019s another big topic.I know. I know. I know.We might talk about that as well.We will direct people to your programme on surviving hormone therapy. But I just want to touch on it. But I want to pick up on something else you said a minute ago, and that was again talking about the covid era and the delays or actually the deluge of patients who haven\u2019t actually presented with symptoms or without, but haven\u2019t been tested. And one of the things that I hear and I\u2019m curious about your experiences is how random PSA testing is. And I\u2019m just wondering how you see that amongst the people you engage with and how you might think this could be fixed.That\u2019s very interesting question. So it\u2019s both random and not random in different respects. If you consider, for example, the guy working in a high end job in an office, possibly with private annual medical checks, those will always include PSA tests. PSA tests are really cheap. So, you know, they would always be included in those. That guy will get picked up really early. I mean he\u2019s got prostate cancer because he will have been having annual PSA tests and a trend or rise that\u2019s excessive will be very quickly picked up. Then if you sort of drop down to the bulk of the population. Some people are aware of the risks of prostate cancer, but most people aren\u2019t. Those who are aware might go to their GP and ask for a test and some GPs will give them a test. Some GPs will talk them out of the test. So that starts to become random.Yes\u2026in that cohort.YesAnd it depends very much on the attitude to that. As you sort of move down the socioeconomic scale, people are less likely to be aware. And it\u2019s another one of these factors where people lower down the scale have poorer health outcomes. And that\u2019s because the PSA testing is entirely the patient\u2019s responsibility to drive it. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s driven through the health service. And when you move down those levels, those patients are predominantly not going to be aware and they\u2019re not going to go to a GP until they\u2019ve got symptoms. And of course, you actually want to pick prostate cancer up before you have symptoms, because you have a much better chance of a cure with fewer side effects.Indeed. Indeed.Then you come down to the actual ethnic minority communities who engage less with health care anywayand are at a higher risk as well.Absolutely. So they\u2019ve got this double whammy. They get prostate cancer generally much, much earlier and tend to get more aggressive prostate cancers. And those people just don\u2019t get picked up, you know, often not until they\u2019ve got quite serious symptoms. So, yes, there\u2019s a big random element in there. But there\u2019s also stratification, according to your you know, your social status, like, I\u2019m afraid there are in many aspects of health care.Yes, there areas with covid and other things recently.We could talk about this and maybe that\u2019s the subject of anther interview. But something else I want to pick up on about sort of about the hormone treatment, because I know that\u2019s something you know a lot about. But we\u2019ve talked a little bit about informed consent and what it means for a patient to seed it or to consent to the recommendation. And I just want to know if this comes up in conversations with the men you deal with. Do you see this playing out? Do people feel that they had informed consent, that they feel that there might be some initial steps to possibly improve that process?Yes, this comes up quite a bit. I mean, the words informed consent are not necessarily used because it\u2019s not a term patients necessarily are familiar with. But, yes, when you consent to a treatment, you need to be informed, which means that you\u2019re given all the information about the treatment, including benefits and risks and what alternatives there might be and what will happen if you don\u2019t have the treatment, whatever options you\u2019ve got. That doesn\u2019t happen. Patients sort of become aware of this later. Generally, you get put on to hormone therapy the moment you\u2019re diagnosed with prostate cancer, possibly after a bit of decision making about treatments. But it depends if you\u2019ve got any choice of treatment: you may not have depending on the stage for your cancer. And no, it\u2019s done just like going to the GP and getting some antibiotics. So here\u2019s a prescription. Start these pills. It is a bit more complicated because usually a couple of weeks later, you start some injections as well. But it\u2019s not\u2026 Nothing much is said about that. I\u2019d actually sort of read about it a bit because I was expecting that this would happen to me. So I wanted to know about it. But when the urologist said to me, oh, you\u2019re starting hormone treatment, he didn\u2019t say anything about it. I said, what are the side effects? You know what he said, your penis will get shorter. Goodbye. That was it.Really?Yeah. And I nearly fell over laughing except it wasn\u2019t quite the moment to do that.Indeed. And does this come up? Is this a shared sentiment or a shared experience with the men you deal with?Yes, because of course, you talk with men who\u2019ve actually been on hormone therapy a while.Of courseAnd they say, well, nobody told me this was going to happen and many of these men are going for radiotherapy. And when you go in for the radiotherapy, you get a multi-page document that lists all the things that might happen to you and you have to sign it. But if you look at the men that went for the hormone therapy and radiotherapy and talked to them some time after the treatment, they will typically say the radiotherapy was a non-issue. It was a few weeks of loose bowels and having difficulty retaining a bladder full of water. The hormone therapy, however, was a major effect on their lives.YesNobody went through the process of describing that to them. There\u2019s a whole load of things that you really need to do to look after your health while you\u2019re on hormone therapy, things like making sure that your blood pressures monitored and that your cholesterol is monitored, your blood glucose levels are monitored because all these are things that hormone therapy can push up. What do you do to prevent yourself from being at risk of osteoporosis. And a really big one, what do you do to protect your sexual function? Which for most men will stop working during hormone therapy. But actually, if you don\u2019t take some active measures to protect yourself at the end of the hormone therapy, you\u2019ll find it\u2019s become permanently damaged because your sex organs don\u2019t work if you leave them for like two or three years not using them.Yeah, so that\u2019s interesting because that brings us into the sort of domain of prehab, which is gaining a lot of momentum for\u2026Yes.\u2026For men. Is it something that you\u2019ve seen successfully applied for men before, specifically for hormone treatment? Because we hear about it a lot before surgery?No, I mean, usually men don\u2019t get any warning they\u2019re going to hormone therapy. But in order to preserve function, there\u2019s a whole set of things you need to do and nobody offers those to you. You have to know that you need to do them. You need to go and ask, can I have some PD5 inhibitors? Can I have a pump? Can I have the things that will help me keep working during \u2026Yes, yes.\u2026when those parts of my body not going to work. Otherwise you come out the other end and those parts have been permanently damaged. So you can\u2019t go for two or three years without an erection and expect the erections will still work because they won\u2019t. You know, it\u2019s crazy because it\u2019s a totally avoidable but major issue with prostate cancer and it just needs some education. And that\u2019s you know, you mentioned my surviving hormone therapy sessions. And that\u2019s something I do go into in quite a lot of detail. And it\u2019s something that I get asked a lot about.Yeah. Now I can see. I mean, it\u2019s because not many people talk about this level of detail or this level of openness. I want to ask you something else that we\u2019ve talked about, which is sort of equal access to treatment, because you\u2019ve actually said to me before that across the health system, you know, depending on where you are and people use the phrase postcode lottery, but depending where you are, you may or may not even be offered a particular treatment. So I want to hear a little bit more from you about how you\u2019ve seen that play out. We see it in focal therapy, for example. But yeah, I\u2019m interested in other treatments and how you see systemically that possibly improving.Well, when the guy gets referred for potential prostate cancer diagnosis, you usually get referred to your local district hospital. A lot of men don\u2019t realise that they can actually be referred to\u2026 In England you can be referred to any hospital in England.Yes, indeedso you could ask your GP to refer you to one of the main cancer centres or you might start at your local district hospital, but you go through a lot of options. You\u2019re diagnosed. There\u2019s this multidisciplinary team, MDT, which is a team of all the urologists and oncologists and radiologists and a number of other people you never see. And each time something changes with your case, they come and discuss it.Yesand they\u2019ll be working out which treatments would be a good idea for you.Yesso, you know, if your hospital offers radiotherapy and prostatectomy, either locally or via a tertiary service, so you get sent to a specialist, you\u2019ll get offered those. If, you mentioned focal therapies, if you would have been an ideal candidate for a focal therapy, but there\u2019s nobody in the MDT that\u2019s involved in focal therapy treatment, because your hospital doesn\u2019t do it and they don\u2019t bring anyone in, you\u2019re not going to get offered that treatment.Yeah.So, yes, you\u2019ll miss out. I see a lot of patients actually who get interested in HIFU because it does get mentioned quite a bit in the press and will actually say, well, how do I get HIFU? And then the hospitals say, well, you\u2019ll have to go somewhere else for that. So the patient will then take the initiative and do it. But that\u2019s the patient driving it.Yes, it is.And of course, most patients won\u2019t have that knowledge. So they will miss out on that opportunity. It doesn\u2019t just happen with the treatment side, I see the same thing happening with diagnostic procedures.How so?If you\u2019re in a hospital that\u2019s got, for example, a PSMA PET scanner, they may think nothing\u2026. If you had a prostatectomy and your PSA started rising and you\u2019ve hit the magic nought point two, which is about the limit that some of the better PSMA PET scans can pick up where your cancer is, they\u2019ll think nothing of just saying right, just go and get a PSMA PET scan. Oh, didn\u2019t find it. We\u2019ll wait till it\u2019s risen to nought point six and we\u2019ll try again. If you\u2019re in a hospital doesn\u2019t have a PSMA PET scanner, it\u2019ll be, well we better stick you on hormone therapy and we\u2019ll wait a bit or we wait till your PSA gets to eight or ten and then we might send you off somewhere else to get a PET scan so you can see a difference there that. That delay may take you past the point where a curative treatment that would have been available to you earlier on, is now no longer an option because the cancer has grown.Yes.\u2026necessarily grown to get your PSA high to meet the higher criteria for a scan.That is like a double whammy, isn\u2019t it? I mean,YesSort of, damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t. So, Andrew, you have so much knowledge and so much accumulated know-how and experience from your own experience, as I said, and from dealing with all these other men who\u2019ve gone through similar journeys. I mean, what would you say are your top challenges that these men face and when they\u2019re diagnosed with prostate cancer, and do you often find that there\u2019s often a sort of a 20/20 hindsight? I wish I did then what I know now or something. And I\u2019m just wondering, what do you think are those challenges and how men might deal them with foresight as opposed to hindsight?It\u2019s an interesting question, because when you\u2019re diagnosed with prostate cancer, it\u2019s almost always out of the blue. It\u2019s something you\u2019re not an expert in. You\u2019re suddenly, oh, cancer, am I going to be dead in eight weeks? You don\u2019t understand it. You don\u2019t understand. So it\u2019s really anxiety generating because your future has suddenly been thrown off course and you\u2019re suddenly not in control of it anymore.Of course, yes.And there\u2019s a lot that we do in support groups to try and educate patients, to teach them what\u2019s happening, make them understand their diagnosis, make them understand disease. And actually, as you start to understand things, you gradually feel that you\u2019re more in control. You understand where your direction is set. It may not be where you wanted it to be set, but it may not be as bad as you imagined from your naive position at the outset. And this really lowers level of anxiety, because you now bring yourself more into control and you can predict the future a bit better. So what we do here a lot is for patients who actually never found the support groups at that stage of their treatment. Sometimes patients come along two or three years later and say, nobody told me there was a support group. I\u2019ve been having treatment for three years at this hospital and I\u2019ve just discovered we\u2019ve got a support group. And that\u2019s crazy because they\u2019re missing out on so much that they could have gained from it. And the reduction in anxiety, talking to other patients who\u2019ve had just about every possible treatment, you know, to gain their experiences and understanding issues. This has got a lot worse during covid, and we don\u2019t fully understand why, but all the support groups are getting far fewer men referred to them by the hospital urology and oncology departments.Oh, really?Yeah.So it\u2019s not a question of migrating to online Zoom groups. It\u2019s more that the referrals themselves are slowing down?Yeah, we\u2019re just not getting the referrals through. And I think it probably relates to a change in the way that patients are interfacing to clinicians. So if you have a telephone call with a clinician, which has obviously become much more common, that tends to be quite a short call, concentrating absolutely on the issue and telling you your results and asking what treatment you want. If you go into an office with a clinician, it might be, oh, how\u2019s your day? Oh, you\u2019ve got your cycling helmet with you, did you cycle in today? And all of that\u2019s gone. And in that conversation that didn\u2019t happen was probably the best. But oh, have you thought about going along and joining a support group? So that\u2019s my theory as to what\u2019s gone wrong\u2026.Interesting.But we don\u2019t really know. I mean, the hospitals tell us they\u2019re telling patients and patients are finding us via some of the route, like Google. That small numbers are and say, no, nobody mentioned it to me at all. Obviously, the day that you\u2019re told you\u2019ve got cancer, you\u2019re probably told several of the things that go in one ear and out the other, to be honest. But in terms of sort of discussing, if you do get hooked up with a support group, then you can talk about things like treatment options. You can talk to other patients. I don\u2019t actually hear many patients thinking that they picked the wrong treatment. And actually, I think that\u2019s a really negative path to go down. You made the best choice you could at that time. Maybe you didn\u2019t have as much information as you have now, but I think decision regret is something that I really try and steer patients away from. Don\u2019t go there. You start from where you are now. What would you do from here? Not what would you do from some position that you can\u2019t get back to.Oh, absolutely. But, Andrew, sorry to say that your insights are incredibly valuable and a lot of the comments you\u2019re making, I actually haven\u2019t heard. I really want to thank you for coming on the programme today and talking to us. And I hope it\u2019s the first of several of these because clearly I\u2019ve only scratched the surface.Well, I\u2019ve really enjoyed it. And thank you so much for asking me. Very happy to talk some more.Good. Links to Andrew\u2019s videos are available on the programme notes to this podcast.
