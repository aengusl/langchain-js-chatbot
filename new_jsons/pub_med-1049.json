{"pageContent": "We review the effectiveness of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) in the management of prostate cancer, and the effect that this treatment has on a patient's quality of life (QoL), based on discussions held at a European symposium on the management of prostate cancer. The overall QoL is reduced in asymptomatic men, and there are known decreases in cognitive function, self-esteem, libido and sexual function. Hot flashes are also a frequent problem. Prolonged ADT can lead to osteoporosis and subsequently fractures. Various effective methods exist to manage and minimize these side-effects; some are specific to the side-effect, whereas other more general methods include lifestyle changes, specific drugs and added hormonal manipulations. Intermittent ADT for patients taking luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists offers a promising method to reduce adverse effects, and possibly increases the time to androgen independence. Initial studies indicate that prostate-specific antigen-based progression with intermittent ADT is similar to that seen with continuous ADT, but there is a reduction in side-effects, leading to an improvement in QoL.", "metaData": {"source": "Contemporary use of hormonal therapy in prostate cancer: managing complications and addressing quality-of-life issues\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17229166/"}}
