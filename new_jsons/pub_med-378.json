{"pageContent": "Objective: In patients with clinically suspected local recurrence of prostate cancer, a lobulated hyperintense mass in the radical prostatectomy fossa can be readily visualized with T2-weighted MRI, but this imaging technique is less successful after treatments such as radiation therapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound, and cryosurgery. We describe the additional value of functional techniques in the assessment of local recurrence.", "metaData": {"source": "Twelve-month prostate volume reduction after MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation of the prostate\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29943185/"}}
