{"pageContent": "What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? In addition to a higher prevalence and biological aggressiveness of prostate cancer, African-Americans tend towards narrower pelvises than Caucasians resulting in a potentially more difficult surgical dissection doing radical prostatectomy and increased positive surgical margins. In this study, there was no difference in urinary or sexual HRQL or overall satisfaction between African-Americans and Caucasians 2 years after radical prostatectomy, suggesting that the potential technical challenges of a narrower pelvis do not translate into poorer outcomes for African-Americans.", "metaData": {"source": "Comprehensive comparison of health-related quality of life after contemporary therapies for localized prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11786586/"}}
