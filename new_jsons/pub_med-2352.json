{"pageContent": "A series of 59 consecutive patients with locally inoperable adenocarcinomas of the prostate were irradiated following a strict protocol and controlled dosimetry in a national cooperative study in the USA. Twenty-one of these patients are living without signs of recurrence or recurrence or metastases. Additional patients who lived 5 to 10 years after treatment without recurrence or metastases died of other causes. Autopsies in several of these cases failed to show residual or metastatic tumor. The failures are primarily due to bone metastases outside of the irradiated territory. The urethral and rectal complications are rare; they can be reduced by further fractionation.", "metaData": {"source": "Dissociation of epithelial and neuroendocrine carcinoma lineages in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate model of prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18156212/"}}
