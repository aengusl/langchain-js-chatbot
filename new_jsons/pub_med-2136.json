{"pageContent": "Background: No randomized controlled trial of prostate cancer screening has been reported and none is likely to be completed in the near future. In the absence of direct evidence, the decision to screen must therefore be based on estimates of benefits and risks. The main risk of screening is overdetection--the detection of cancer that, if left untreated, would not cause death. In this study the authors estimate the level of overdetection that might result from annual screening of men aged 50-70.", "metaData": {"source": "Socioeconomic disadvantage but not remoteness affects short-term survival in prostate cancer: A population-based study using competing risks\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27558311/"}}
