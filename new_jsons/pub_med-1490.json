{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is the most common cancer to affect men in the UK. Treatment options depend on the grade of tumour, the patient's co-existing diseases and choice of treatment. One potentially curative option is surgery, specifically a radical retropubic prostatectomy or variation thereof. As a consequence of the surgery, men commonly experience two side-effects: urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction (ED). This paper outlines the clinical management of ED following surgery and aims to provide an overview of how to assess a man who has developed ED and discuss the various treatment options available, along with the efficacy in terms of recovery of erections.", "metaData": {"source": "Psychosocial issues related to sexual functioning among African-American prostate cancer survivors and their spouses\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20187071/"}}
