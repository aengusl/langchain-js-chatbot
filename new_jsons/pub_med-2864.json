{"pageContent": "Objectives: MR-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation (TULSA) has primarily been investigated for whole-gland prostate ablation, even though the technology is also well-suited for partial gland treatment. The objectives were to perform a clinical service evaluation of partial to whole-gland TULSA for patients with localized prostate cancer (CaP). TULSA was also evaluated as a combined therapy for a subset of patients presenting with both cancer and concurrent benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH).", "metaData": {"source": "Partnership and outcomes in men with prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19626653/"}}
