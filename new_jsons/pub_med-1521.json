{"pageContent": "Background: Although subtle technical variation affects potency preservation during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RARP), most prostatectomy studies focus on achieving the optimal anatomic nerve-sparing dissection plane. However, the impact of active assistant/surgeon neurovascular bundle (NVB) countertraction on sexual function outcomes has not been studied or quantified.", "metaData": {"source": "Comparative quality-of-life analysis after radical prostatectomy or external beam radiation for localized prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10475363/"}}
