{"pageContent": "Study Type - Outcomes (cohort sample) Level of Evidence 2b. What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? The study compares the sexual function of men with low-risk prostate cancer who chose active surveillance (expectant management) with similar men who received radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy. The first group appeared to be sexually active more frequently and had less erectile dysfunction. The study was non-randomized. No other studies exist on the effect of active surveillance on sexual function vs other treatment methods.", "metaData": {"source": "A systematic review of salvage focal therapies for localised non-metastatic radiorecurrent prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32676441/"}}
