{"pageContent": "Asymptomatic men with low-risk, early-stage prostate cancer are eligible for active surveillance (AS), which offers a means to monitor the cancer while delaying treatment. However, AS operates within a unique set of circumstances that advocate monitoring, rather than immediate treatment, and men's health practices are central to coping with the inherent uncertainty of living with an untreated cancer. A qualitative study was completed to describe the range of men's self-management strategies used to overcome AS-related uncertainty. The study findings reveal two strategies. First, positioning prostate cancer as benign through stoicism and solitary discourses were common to men intent on \"living a normal life.\" Second, men committed to \"doing something extra\" complemented AS protocols, and often collaborated with their wives to focus on diet as an adjunct therapy. Although most participants exhibited typical men's health practices, it is clear that tailored AS psychosocial interventions will benefit men and their families.", "metaData": {"source": "Mental distress and need for psychosocial support in prostate cancer patients: An observational cross-sectional study\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32597270/"}}
