{"pageContent": "The efficacy of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) used for the treatment of localized prostate cancers has been demonstrated over the past decade. We present our early results after HIFU used as a single session in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. A total of 58 patients were treated using the Ablatherm HIFU device with or without transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). HIFU failure was defined as the presence of a cancer remnant on repeated biopsies or three consecutive increases in the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >/=1.0 ng/ml. The mean follow-up was 14 months (range, 6-21 months). After HIFU treatment, 78% of patients had a decreased PSA level to <0.5 ng/ml within 3 months. The median value of the last PSA was 0.6 ng/ml and the median nadir PSA was 0.2 ng/ml. The success rates of HIFU were 85, 77 and 47% in low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups, respectively. The HIFU failure rate was closely associated with clinical stage, presence of cancer on TURP chips and nadir PSA on univariate analysis. However, the only significant predictor for HIFU failure was the nadir PSA value by multivariate Cox regression analysis. The operation-related complications were minimal. Although both the period and number of patients were limited to evaluate the clinical efficacy, HIFU appears to be a safe and effective treatment option in selected patients with prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "[Could the transrectal prostate biopsy predict the rate of positive lymph nodes in prostate cancer patients?]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18983007/"}}
