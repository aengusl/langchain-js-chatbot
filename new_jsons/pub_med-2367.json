{"pageContent": "Androgen has been shown to promote the proliferation of prostate cancer through the action of the androgen receptor (AR). Mutation (T877A) of the AR gene found in an androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, has been postulated to be involved in hypersensitivity and loss of specificity for androgen. In the present study, trafficking of AR and AR (T877A) in living prostate and non-prostate cancer cell lines under high and low concentrations of androgen and antiandrogen was investigated by tagging green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the receptors. In the presence of a high concentration of androgen, AR-GFP localized in the nucleus by forming discrete clusters in all cell lines. AR (T877A)-GFP was also translocated to the nucleus in LNCaP and COS-1 cells by the addition of a high concentration of androgen. In contrast, in the presence of a low concentration of androgen, the translocation of AR-GFP and AR (T877A)-GFP was observed in LNCaP cells, but not in COS-1 cells. Upon the addition of antiandrogen, AR-GFP was translocated to the nucleus but did not form subnuclear foci in both COS-1 and LNCaP cells, whereas AR (T877A)-GFP in both cells was translocated to the nucleus with subnuclear foci. The present study demonstrates the differential response of nuclear trafficking of AR and its mutant in prostate cancer cell lines and COS cells, and the subcellular and subnuclear compartmentalization provide important information on the sensitivity of the AR mutation.", "metaData": {"source": "GermLine Variation in Superoxide Dismutase-2 (SOD2) and Survival Outcomes After Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Results of a Test and Validation Set Analysis\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25662905/"}}
