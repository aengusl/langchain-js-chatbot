{"pageContent": "An increasing amount of evidence points at important roles for estrogen receptors in prostate carcinogenesis and progression. Of the two estrogen receptors, estrogen receptor \u03b2 is the most prominent within the prostate gland. Although there is much yet to be known, the findings from the discovery of the receptor in 1996 until now point at a role of the receptor in maintaining differentiation and reducing cellular proliferation in the prostate. Moreover, estrogen receptor \u03b2 is the main target for phytoestrogens, perhaps at least partially explaining the difference in incidence of prostate cancer in the Western world compared to Asia where the intake of soy-based, phytoestrogen-rich food is higher. The tumor suppressive capability of estrogen receptor \u03b2 makes it a promising drug target for the treatment and prevention of prostate cancer. This review will focus on different aspects of estrogen receptor signaling and prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Management of prostate cancer.
