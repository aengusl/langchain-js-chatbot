{"pageContent": "Purpose: We compared pathological outcomes after radical prostatectomy for a population based sample of men with low risk prostate cancer initially on active surveillance and undergoing delayed prostatectomy vs those treated with immediate surgery in order to better understand this expectant management approach outside of the context of academic cohorts. We hypothesized that delays in surgery due to initial surveillance would not impact surgical pathological outcomes.", "metaData": {"source": "Outcome research: prostate cancer databases\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12474540/"}}
