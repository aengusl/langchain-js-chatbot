{"pageContent": "Purpose: Cysts of prostate tissue are common. Most cases are diagnosed accidently during ultrasound but they sometimes have clinical relevance when related to lower urinary tract symptoms, infertility or the expression of neoplastic disorders. Clinical relevance is linked to the differential diagnosis of the different types of cysts. We provide an updated classification of prostate cyst disorders and indicate how these disorders appear on transrectal ultrasound based on our experience and a literature review.", "metaData": {"source": "Can quantitative analysis of multi-parametric MRI independently predict failure of focal salvage HIFU therapy in men with radio-recurrent prostate cancer?\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34049783/"}}
