{"pageContent": "To improve future drug development and patient management for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), surrogate biomarkers that are linked to relevant outcomes are urgently needed. A biomarker must be measurable, reproducible, linked to relevant clinical outcomes, and demonstrate clinical utility. This area is rapidly evolving, with recent trials in patients with CRPC incorporating the detection of circulating tumour cells (CTCs), imaging, and patient-reported outcome biomarkers. We discuss the framework for the development of biomarkers for CRPC, including different categories and contexts of use. We also highlight the requirements of analytical validation, the sequence of trials needed for clinical validation and regulatory approval, and the future outlook for imaging and CTC biomarkers.", "metaData": {"source": "Growth Modulatory Role of Zinc in Prostate Cancer and Application to Cancer Therapeutics\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32340289/"}}
