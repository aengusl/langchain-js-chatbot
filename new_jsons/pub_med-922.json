{"pageContent": "Background: Prostate cancer survivors' post-surgery sexual problems are well documented and long lasting. Partners' distress in this context leads to psychological morbidity which is poorly understood. Given the prevalence of prostate cancer diagnoses in older men, partners' distress represents a public health concern.

It can lead to further research and health-care provisions that will support couples in prostate cancer survivorship towards improved mental health and health outcomes.", "metaData": {"source": "Sexual function and rehabilitation after radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a review\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33408347/"}}
