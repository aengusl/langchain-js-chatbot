{"pageContent": "African American men participated in a screening initiative and completed the 22-item Barriers to Prostate Cancer Screening Checklist. Forty-three men received a digital rectal exam (DRE) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) laboratory test. The age of the males was M = 56.4 (range = 45-76) years; 47% were compliant with the American Cancer Society annual screening guidelines for high-risk individuals. Nineteen men from the screened group completed a 22-item Response to Barriers Checklist. The barrier ranked a \"big problem\" for not getting a prostate exam, and the highest by 32% (n = 6) of the sample was \"Too many things going on in their lives.\" The lowest ranked problem by 100% of the participants was \"Takes too long to get an appointment.\" Two individuals reported taking the over-the-counter supplement, saw palmetto. It is important that when planning a health screening in the community, both barriers and advantages be evaluated during the planning and before the implementation phase of the project.", "metaData": {"source": "Socioeconomic and clinical factors influence the interval between positive prostate biopsy and radical prostatectomy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23107396/"}}
