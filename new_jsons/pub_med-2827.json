{"pageContent": "Indications for checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) are growing rapidly within the field of oncology; however, they continue to have heterogeneous outcomes in different cancers. Other than mismatch repair deficiency, there are no consistent tests to determine a tumor's susceptibility. By exploring factors beyond the cancer cell, researchers have learned that the efficacy of CPIs may be governed by a myriad of variable host factors, including the tumor microenvironment (TME) and gut microbiome (GMB). The GMB serves as one of the primary organs of immune defense and has well-established local and systemic effects on the host immune system. Recent investigations suggest that the GMB also affects the TME. This review article discusses the concepts of a TME and a GMB and their effects on responses to CPIs. It also reviews recent research investigating these 3 topics, and how it can be applied to using CPIs in prostate cancer. By highlighting this important pathophysiologic process, we hope to provide insight into a possible explanation for differences in interindividual response to CPIs, discuss a potential method for transferring treatment efficacy between patients, and propose a method for expanding the use of CPIs to prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Cribriform Prostate Cancer: Clinical Pathologic and Molecular Considerations\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34058243/"}}
