{"pageContent": "Most men treated with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer will be cured of prostate cancer; however, some men will experience treatment failure. Androgen deprivation therapy is well established in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. Adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy, following prostatectomy and/or radiotherapy, has been studied in the high-risk prostate cancer setting to try to reduce the risk of recurrence and improve patient outcomes.
