{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer affects couples' sexual intimacy, but men rarely use recommended proerectile aids. This mixed-methods study aimed to identify couples' preprostatectomy barriers to sexual recovery. Interviews about anticipated sexual recovery were paired with surveys: the Dyadic Assessment Scale, the Protective Buffering Scale, the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite, the Sexual Experience Questionnaire (men), and the Female Sexual Function Index. Potential barriers were derived using Grounded Theory. Quantitative data triangulated qualitative findings. Heterosexual couples (N = 28) participated. Men's average age was 62 years and their partners' average age was 58 years. Preexisting and diagnosis-related barriers included aging-related sexual dysfunction, inadequate sexual problem-solving skills, stressors, worry, avoidance of planning for sexual recovery, and dislike of artificially assisted sex. Participants endorsed moderate/high marital satisfaction (DAS: for men, M = 110.0, SD = 11.4; for partners, M = 114.1, SD = 12.1) and communication (PBS: for men, M = 24.5.2, SD = 6.1; for partners, M = 25.1, SD \u00b1 6.2). Men reported mild erectile dysfunction and incontinence (EPIC sexual function M = 76.6, SD = 21.5, urinary incontinence M = 88.4, SD = 18.2). Men's couple sexual satisfaction was lowest (Sexual Experience Questionnaire: M = 60.1, SD = 26.9). Mean total Female Sexual Function Index was low (M = 21.6, SD = 7.8). Heterosexual couples face prostatectomy-related sexual side-effects having experienced developmental sexual losses. Couples use avoidant strategies to defend against worry about cancer and anticipated prostatectomy-related sexual changes. These potential barriers are modifiable if couples can learn to cope with sexual losses and accept sexual rehabilitation strategies.", "metaData": {"source": "Sexual (dys)function after radiotherapy for prostate cancer: a review\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11849790/"}}
