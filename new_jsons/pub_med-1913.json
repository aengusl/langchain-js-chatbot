{"pageContent": "Approximately a third of the patients diagnosed with prostate cancer will present with advanced disease. Metastasis commonly occurs to the regional lymph nodes and/or the bony skeleton. Total androgen ablation by means of castration, antiandrogens or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs remains the standard of care for patients. However, responses are short-lived in most patients with progression of hormone refractory disease being inevitable over the course of 2 to 3 years. Advances in molecular and cellular biology have led to an improved understanding of prostate biology and the characteristics of prostate cancer. Based on this improved understanding, several new approaches are being developed for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. These range from traditional dietary modifications to altering the microcellular environment of the prostate cancer cell and gene therapy. This article provides an overview of some of the more promising novel therapeutic approaches being investigated in prostate cancer. While many of these treatments are still experimental, some are undergoing preliminary clinical trials and will hopefully result in new management choices for these patients in the near future.", "metaData": {"source": "How does active surveillance for prostate cancer affect quality of life?
