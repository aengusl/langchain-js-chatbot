{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer treatment has undergone vast development over the last few decades, but the most notable changes have included nerve-sparing open radical prostatectomy, laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, including robot-assisted and, more recently, cryotherapy and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). While radical surgery is the current gold standard, the less invasive therapeutic options of cryotherapy and HIFU are regarded as largely experimental by governing bodies. In the case of cryotherapy, a wealth of experience has been accumulated demonstrating its efficacy. Initially used as a salvage treatment for radiation-failed prostate cancer, cryotherapy has been widely used as a primary treatment for localized and locally advanced prostate cancer. More recently, there has been interest expressed in the concept of focal therapy in prostate cancer. This has been evaluated as a primary treatment for prostate cancer, but little information is available regarding the potential use as a salvage treatment. In this article, we evaluate the potential for focal treatment in the salvage setting.", "metaData": {"source": "Focal therapy in prostate cancer: modalities, findings and future considerations\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20842187/"}}
