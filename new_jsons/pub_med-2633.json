{"pageContent": "Currently, Black men in the United States are greater than 1.5 times as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer and more than twice as likely to succumb to the disease. While racial disparities in prostate cancer have been well documented, we must analyze these disparities in the correct context. Discussion of these disparities without correctly describing race as a social construct and acknowledging the impact of structural racism is insufficient.
