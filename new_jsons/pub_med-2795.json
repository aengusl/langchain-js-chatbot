{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer remains a common cause of cancer death in men. Applications of new genomic technologies to the recent development of high-quality prostate cancer models in multiple contexts have added great molecular insight into the development of and progression to metastasis. Genomic analysis of DNA, RNA, and protein alterations allows for the global assessment of this disease and provides the molecular framework to improve risk classification, outcome prediction, and development of targeted therapies. The creation of expression profiles and signatures will allow the evaluation of cancer phenotypes and give insight into determining those with increased risk of cancer, identification of critical pathways involved in the development of cancer, prediction of disease outcome, and assessment of the response of cancer to established and novel therapies. This review focuses on highlighting recent work in genomics and on its role in evaluating potential genetic modifiers of prostate cancer and novel biomarkers that may help with prostate cancer diagnosis, its potential to provide a better understanding of prostate cancer behavior and transition to metastatic disease, and its role in current and new therapies in prostate cancer. This framework has the exciting potential to be predictive and provide personalized and individual treatment to the large number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer each year.", "metaData": {"source": "Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27787754/"}}
