{"pageContent": "This study aimed to explore men's experiences of social support after non-nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy. A qualitative study based on Gadamer's hermeneutic phenomenology was designed. In-depth interviews were conducted with 16 men who had undergone a non-nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy. Data analysis was performed using ATLAS.ti software. From this analysis, two main themes emerged: \"The partner as a source of support and conflict after a prostatectomy,\" which includes empathetic reconnection with the partner and changes in sexual and cohabitation patterns and \"The importance of social and professional circles,\" which addresses the shortcomings of the healthcare system in terms of sexual information and counseling as well as the role of friends within social support. The study suggests the need to establish interventions that address interpersonal communication and attention to social and informational support and include both the patient and those closest to them.", "metaData": {"source": "Impact of Androgen Deprivation Therapy on Sexual and Hormonal Function in Patients Receiving Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26964281/"}}
