{"pageContent": "Background: To overcome the limitations regarding two dimensional (2D) greyscale (GS) transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy in prostate cancer (PCa) detection and tissue packaging in biopsy processing, there is an ongoing focus on new imaging and pathology techniques. A three-dimensional (3D) model of the prostate with biopsy needle guidance can be generate by the Navigo\u2122 workstation (UC-care, Israel). The SmartBX\u2122 system (UC-care, Israel) provides a prostate biopsy core preembedding method. The aim of this study was to compare cancer detection rates between the 3D TRUS-guidance and preembedding method with conventional 2D GS TRUS-guidance among patients undergoing prostate biopsies.", "metaData": {"source": "Multimodal image-guided prostate fusion biopsy based on automatic deformable registration\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26054983/"}}
