{"pageContent": "Immune infiltration in Prostate Cancer (PCa) was reported to be strongly associated with clinical outcomes. However, previous research could not elucidate the diversity of different immune cell types that contribute to the functioning of the immune response system. In the present study, the CIBERSORT method was employed to evaluate the relative proportions of immune cell profiling in PCa samples, adjacent tumor samples and normal samples. Three types of molecular classification were identified in tumor samples using the 'CancerSubtypes' package of the R software. Each subtype had specific molecular and clinical characteristics. In addition, functional enrichment was analyzed in each subtype. The submap and Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) algorithms were also used to predict clinical response to the immune checkpoint blockade. Moreover, the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database was employed to screen for potential chemotherapeutic targets for the treatment of PCa. The results showed that Cluster I was associated with advanced PCa and was more likely to respond to immunotherapy. The findings demonstrated that differences in immune responses may be important drivers of PCa progression and response to treatment. Therefore, this comprehensive assessment of the 22 immune cell types in the PCa Tumor Environment (TEM) provides insights on the mechanisms of tumor response to immunotherapy and may help clinicians explore the development of new drugs.", "metaData": {"source": "Surgery for prostate cancer: rationale, technique and outcomes\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12400995/"}}
