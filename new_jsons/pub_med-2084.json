{"pageContent": "Introduction: Each year more than 60,000 German men are diagnosed with prostate cancer. The incidence nearly doubled in the last 10 years due to intensified use of PSA testing for early detection. To date, either radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy is recommended for treatment of localized prostate cancer. Both strategies have similar survival chances (83-94%), but show different side effects.
