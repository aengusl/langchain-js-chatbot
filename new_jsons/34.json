{"pageContent": "There are many different treatments for prostate cancer, with some that are more common than others. Two prostate cancer treatments that are often confused are HIFU and radiation treatment.\u00a0However, there are some key differences between them, particularly when it comes to side effects.\u00a0\u00a0With any medical treatment, it\u2019s important to make an informed decision. Here\u2019s what you need to know about HIFU vs radiation for prostate cancer so that you can choose which treatment will be right for you.HIFU stands for High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound \u2014 a popular focal therapy for prostate cancer that uses high-energy beams to heat and destroy cancer cells so that they can be metabolised by the body.\u00a0It isn\u2019t currently available on the NHS, except in clinical trials.\u00a0Radiation treatment, or radiotherapy, is a common cancer treatment that uses high-energy waves that are similar to x-rays to destroy cancer cells. It is used to treat lots of types of cancer, including prostate cancer.\u00a0Unlike HIFU treatment, radiation treatment is less focused which means that it generally targets a wider area of the body.\u00a0\u00a0On the surface, HIFU and radiation treatment sound extremely similar. Nevertheless, there are some key differences between them that could impact your decision about which you would prefer to have to treat your prostate cancer.\u00a0All treatments come with side effects, and prostate cancer treatments are no exception. However, it\u2019s important to note that type and severity of side effects can vary between patients, and that every experience is different.\u00a0One of the main reasons why many patients with prostate cancer choose HIFU treatment is because, compared to conventional NHS treatments, the focal nature of HIFU means it has far fewer long-term side effects. You will need to wear a catheter for a few days, but after this is removed, you shouldn\u2019t experience any long-term effects.Side effects of HIFU are typically mild and short-term, and may include:Nevertheless, our evidence shows that with HIFU, 100% of men had no urinary problems within two weeks of treatment, and 95% of men enjoyed normal erectile function at six weeks post-treatment.\u00a0There are both short-term and longer-term side effects associated with radiation therapy. Initially, patients can expect to experience skin redness and soreness in the area being targeted.\u00a0Other side effects tend to start around two weeks after the start of a course of radiotherapy. These include:There are also many longer-term consequences associated with radiation therapy. These can start during treatment, or even months or years later.\u00a0These side effects are rarely given enough attention, but we feel it\u2019s important for patients to be aware so that they can make an informed decision about their prostate cancer treatment. They include, but aren\u2019t limited to:The length of the treatment is another key difference between HIFU and radiation therapy.\u00a0HIFU is generally a single, one-off treatment that takes between one to three hours, depending on the size of the area to be treated.\u00a0Before the treatment, you\u2019ll need an enema to empty your bowels, which makes it simpler for your doctor to see the prostate and administer the treatment. HIFU is performed under general anaesthetic, meaning you\u2019ll be asleep for the procedure. A probe will be placed inside your back passage which will emit the high-intensity ultrasound energy used to break down the cancer cells, as well as feed back ultrasound images of the area.\u00a0Since the beam of light is about the size of a grain of rice, the probe will need to be moved around to treat all areas of the prostate where the cancer is. However, the procedure is performed as a day case and you\u2019ll be able to go home the same day.Radiation therapy is also performed as an outpatient treatment (or day case).\u00a0However, radiotherapy requires multiple sessions. Most people with localised prostate cancer will have a course of radiotherapy that involves around 20 sessions carried out over a period of four weeks. Exactly how your treatment plan looks will depend on your individual circumstances.\u00a0Radiation therapy is performed externally, and each session usually lasts around 10 minutes depending on the size of the area being targeted. There is virtually zero preparation time and you can go home immediately after your treatment.\u00a0When it comes to the success of both treatments, it\u2019s fair to say that the results are comparable.\u00a0Radiation therapy has long been considered to be a very effective treatment technique for many types of cancers, including prostate cancer. Men with localised prostate cancer who are treated with radiation therapy have a cure rate of 95.5% for intermediate-risk prostate cancer, and 91.3% for high-risk prostate cancer. This equates to an overall five-year survival rate of 98.8%.\u00a0Nevertheless, HIFU has very positive clinically-proven outcomes too. Following a decade-long clinical trial conducted between 2006 and 2016, results showed a 100% cancer-specific survival rate, with 74% of patients needing no further treatment after their initial focal therapy treatment.\u00a0However, some of the most impressive study results came when looking at the side effects of HIFU. 98% of men had no issue with urinary incontinence after the treatment, while just 2% needed to use incontinence pads for just a couple of weeks.\u00a0Meanwhile, 75% of men had no issues with sexual dysfunction at all, with 20% using over-the-counter medication (but given their age, may have been using this before HIFU treatment).\u00a0When it comes to HIFU vs radiation for prostate cancer, there are some key differences between these treatments. Focal therapies such as HIFU are an effective way of treating early to moderate-stage prostate cancer while minimising the risk of experiencing long-term side effects.\u00a0Find out more about HIFU by contacting our experienced and knowledgeable team today.\u00a0Your email address will not be published.
