{"pageContent": "Frequently knowledge of elemental content of human organs and tissues is required for a variety of applications. These can include brachytherapy and radiotherapy planning, radiation dosimetry and radiation protection. Revised reference values of chemical element mass fractions in normal and cancerous prostate tissues of the Reference (European Caucasian) Man are suggested as a result of this work. Autopsies of 37 apparently healthy males (mean age 55 \u00b1 11 years, range 41-87 years) provided the prostatic tissues studied. The investigated individuals lived in a non-industrial, Central European region of Russia and had suffered sudden death. Also, tissues were studied from 62 subjects with prostate cancer (mean age 65 \u00b1 10 years, range 40-79 years). Sixty-seven elemental mass fractions were determined in each of these 99 prostates. Analytical methods employed were inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry, neutron activation analysis with high-resolution spectrometry of short-lived and long-lived radionuclides, energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence analysis, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Whichever method was employed, the necessary quality control measures were utilized. Results presented here include a systematic analysis of both the prostatic data presented here for 67 elements and also others' published findings, to make a total of 71 elemental mass fraction values.", "metaData": {"source": "[Completeness and quality of multidisciplinary team meetings: the example of prostate cancer in the Mid-Pyrenees region]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22035915/"}}
