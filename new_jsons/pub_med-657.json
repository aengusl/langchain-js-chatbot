{"pageContent": "Prostate brachytherapy is a radiotherapy technique for early stage prostate cancer that uses imaging guidance to place radioactive sources directly into the prostate gland. Transrectal ultrasound is used to facilitate a template-guided transperineal approach to the prostate and permits a highly conformal method of prostate radiotherapy with doses far higher than can be achieved with other radiation techniques. Maturing data has validated this technique as an acceptable treatment option with favourable and durable biochemical outcomes. The radiologist has a major role to play in the process: patient selection, guiding source delivery and follow-up after treatment all require close collaboration with colleagues in Radiation Oncology and Medical Physics. This review emphasises the specific contribution of imaging in the context of currently reported outcomes data.", "metaData": {"source": "Clinical outcome of transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy, targeting eight cores, for detecting prostate cancer in Japanese men\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15162826/"}}
