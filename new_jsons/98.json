{"pageContent": "HIFU Focal Therapy is a NICE approved treatment for prostate cancer which has undergone numerous clinical trials. At present the most extensive, evidence-based study on the outcome of Focal Therapy for prostate cancer is the\u2018Multicentre Study of 5-year Outcomes\u2019\u00a0which was published in October 2018 \u2013 the key findings of which are outlined below. A recently published landmark study comparing the outcomes of Focal Therapy and Radical Prostatectomy treatments for prostate cancer is also outlined on this page.In this 10-year clinical trial, conducted between 2006 and 2016 in the UK, 625 men were treated with HIFU Focal Therapy, giving a median follow up of 5 years. The results of the trial, which were published in 2018, showed that the therapy is an effective treatment with a low probability of side effects.100%\u00a0cancer-specific survival rate88%\u00a0failure-free survival (FFS) rate \u2013 defined as freedom from radical or systemic therapy, metastases and cancer-specific mortality.74%\u00a0needed no further treatment after their initial Focal Therapy treatment19%\u00a0needed at least one additional Focal Therapy treatment7%\u00a0required Radical Treatment following Focal Therapy98%\u00a0had no issue with urinary continence after the treatment2%\u00a0needed pad use for a couple of weeks75%\u00a0had no issues20%\u00a0needed ongoing over-the-counter medicine) but may have been using this before treatment5%\u00a0needed some ongoing additional support.*For men with erectile function pre-treatment\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The overall conclusion was that HIFU Focal Therapy for select patients with clinically significant, non-metastatic prostate cancer is effective in the\u00a0medium term\u00a0and has a\u00a0low probability of side effects.\u00a0It is important to note that as the study was conducted with a follow up of 5 years it can only include the \u2018medium term\u2019 in its conclusion, as long term is defined as a 10 year span.This study is the biggest of its kind and demonstrates why Focal Therapy should be part of any treatment consideration process for early-stage prostate cancer.\u00a0Download the full report here:Review our\u00a0Patient StoriesThis landmark 8-year study led by Imperial College London and co-authored by TFTC consultant urologists Tim Dudderidge and Raj Nigam, compared the oncological outcomes of 246 Focal Therapy and 246 Radical Prostatectomy patients at 3, 5 and 8 years post treatment. The patients were matched according to their year of surgery, age, PSA, Gleason score, maximum cancer core length, use of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, and T-stage. The results of the study, published in 2020, have shown that for patients with low to intermediate prostate cancer, Focal Therapy provides similar cancer control and better post-op function compared to Radical Prostatectomy.The rates of failure-free survival (FFS) \u2013 defined as freedom from local salvage therapy or systemic therapy or development of metastases \u2013 for the two treatments were as follows:The rates of erectile function* and urinary continence post treatment were as follows:*Erectile function scores include men who did not have erectile function pre-treatment\u00a0The key finding of the study was that \u2018In patients with non-metastatic low- intermediate prostate cancer, oncological outcomes over 8 years were similar between Focal Therapy and Radical Prostatectomy\u2019.This study is the biggest of its kind and demonstrates why Focal Therapy should be part of any treatment consideration process for early-stage prostate cancer.\u00a0Download the full report here:Review our\u00a0Patient Stories Name\n \n Phone Number\n \n Email\n \n Enquiry.\n \nPlease leave this field empty.\n\nAt The Focal Therapy Clinic we are passionate about prostate cancer sufferers knowing about all of their treatment options.We know that settling on the right treatment is a big decision for you.
