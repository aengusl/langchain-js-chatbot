{"pageContent": "The incidence of prostate cancer, while still lower than in Western nations, is increasing rapidly in Asian countries due to a more westernized lifestyle. Prostate cancer mortality is declining in the USA, where most prostate cancers are diagnosed in the early stage. In contrast, the mortality rates of prostate cancer in Asian countries are expected to continue to increase, because the percentage of advanced-stage prostate cancers remains high. Therefore, early detection by prostate-specific antigen screening and a comprehensive strategy for cancer prevention are essential for Asian people. The exposure rate of prostate-specific antigen screening is very low in Asian countries. Increased prostate-specific antigen screening may reduce the mortality rate. The stances regarding population screening differ among countries. Urological associations should promote population screening. Reliable data from Asian countries are needed. The prostate cancer incidence is low in Asian countries, perhaps due to high soy consumption. Isoflavones may prevent prostate cancer in Asian countries, but that is not yet clear. A large, multinational study in Asia is needed to clarify whether or not isoflavone consumption shows efficacy in preventing prostate cancer. Clinical data suggest that hormonal therapy is more effective in Asians than in Westerners. Clinical guidelines should consider including hormonal therapy as one of the options for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. At the same time, effort should be made to decrease the adverse effects of each treatment. Collaborative studies on the treatment of prostate cancer should be carried out among Asian countries.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer update: 2006\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17414641/"}}
