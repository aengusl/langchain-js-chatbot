{"pageContent": "Recently, minimally invasive therapy has been a key word in the medical field. Many new therapies have been developed in the field of urology. In this area, bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) instillation therapy, transurethral resection of the bladder tumor and intra-arterial infusion with irradiation therapy are noted as minimally invasive therapies for bladder cancer. Laparoscopic prostatectomy, brachytherapy, three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) have also been developed as minimally invasive therapies for prostate cancer. Though the establishment of the validity of each treatment will still take time, the best treatment for each patient should be chosen case by case, including considerations of postoperative quality of life and economic efficiency.", "metaData": {"source": "Abdominal obesity as risk factor for prostate cancer diagnosis and high grade disease: a prospective multicenter Italian cohort study\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21925906/"}}
