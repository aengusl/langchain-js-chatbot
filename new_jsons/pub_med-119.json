{"pageContent": "During 2007-2012 748 patients with prostate cancer (PCa) underwent ultrasound ablation (HIFU). Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the prevalence and risk of disease progression: low risk (localized prostate cancer, 465 (62%) of patients) stage T1-2N0M0, total Gleason score < or = 6, the level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) less than 20 ng/ml), high risk (locally advanced prostate cancer, 251 (34%) of patients)--stage T2-3N0M0, total Gleason score < or = 9, the PSA level from 20 to 60 ng/ml, the presence of local recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RPE) and external beam radiation (EBRT)--32 (4%) patients. Median follow-up after HIFU-therapy was 36 (3-54) months. At 12 and 48 months after treatment in patients with a low risk of progression median PSA was 0.2 and 0.5 ng/ml, in the group with a high risk 0.8 and 1.2 ng/ml, in patients with local recurrence after RPE and EBRT--0.5 and 1.7 ng/ml respectively. Generally HIFU treatment was successful in 90.9% of patients. It is shown that HIFU is safe minimally invasive treatment for localizes and locally advanced prostate cancer. It can be successfully performed in patients with local recurrence after RPE and EBRT.", "metaData": {"source": "Assessing high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment of prostate cancer with hyperpolarized 13 C dual-agent imaging of metabolism and perfusion\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30022550/"}}
