{"pageContent": "HIFU is used in the treatment of cancer (prostate, breast) and uterine fibroma but not yet in TNs. This case report describes the first successful ablation of a toxic TN with HIFU. TSH and radioiodine scan normalization were achieved without complications and maintained for 18 months. HIFU treatment is a minimally invasive technique that may be an effective safe alternative to radioiodine or surgery in patients with toxic TNs.", "metaData": {"source": "Peri-operative, functional and early oncologic outcomes of salvage robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy after high-intensity focused ultrasound partial ablation\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32611411/"}}
