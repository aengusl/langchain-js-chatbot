{"pageContent": "Introduction: Focal therapy (FT) of the prostate for low risk prostate cancer (PCa) is an alternative to traditional definite treatment options like external beam radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy. However, follow up after FT is still challenging and is subject to current studies. Significance of imaging after FT such as multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) is currently not well established. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of alternative imaging during the follow up of low risk PCa treated with focal HIFU therapy using CEUS and image fusion.", "metaData": {"source": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation of Prostate Cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33021440/"}}
