{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is a paradigm tumor model for heterogeneity in almost every sense. Its clinical, spatial, and morphological heterogeneity divided by the high-level molecular genetic diversity outline the complexity of this disease in the clinical and research settings. In this review, we summarize the main aspects of prostate cancer heterogeneity at different levels, with special attention given to the spatial heterogeneity within the prostate, and to the standard morphological heterogeneity, with respect to tumor grading and modern classifications. We also cover the complex issue of molecular genetic heterogeneity, discussing it in the context of the current evidence of the genetic characterization of prostate carcinoma; the interpatient, intertumoral (multifocal disease), and intratumoral heterogeneity; tumor clonality; and metastatic disease. Clinical and research implications are summarized and serve to address the most pertinent problems stemming from the extreme heterogeneity of prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "The need to measure quality of life in a prostate cancer screening trial\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8853496/"}}
