{"pageContent": "Twenty-five patients termed the method group, having a carcinoma of the prostate, underwent a subcapsular orchiectomy, followed by the placement of an intracapsular prosthesis for anti-androgen treatment. In tandem, a control group of 16 patients, having a carcinoma of the prostate underwent, a total orchiectomy. Further, a histological study of a testicular capsula was performed on an autopsy specimen, but almost no seminiferous residue was detected. Postoperatively, serum testosterone levels decreased to less than 10% of their Preoperative levels, and remained at this level for 30 months. Similar results were obtained in both the method group and the control group postoperative questionnaires showed that the method group experienced less mental and physical stress than did the control group. In a society composed largely of elderly people, this type of operation can be very beneficial to those suffering from prostate carcinoma in maintaining the quality of their lives.", "metaData": {"source": "Is it possible to provide a prognosis after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer by means of a PSA regression model?\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16011041/"}}
