{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is the commonest cancer in the developed world. There is an inherited component to this disease as shown in familial and twin studies. However, the discovery of these variants has been difficult. The emergence of genome-wide association studies has led to the identification of over 46 susceptibility loci. Their clinical utility to predict risk, response to treatment, or treatment toxicity, remains undefined. Large consortia are needed to achieve adequate statistical power to answer these genetic-clinical and genetic-epidemiological questions. International collaborations are currently underway to link genetic with clinical/epidemiological data to develop risk prediction models, which could direct screening and treatment programs.", "metaData": {"source": "The changing face of prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16278465/"}}
