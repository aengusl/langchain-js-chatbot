{"pageContent": "The study was aimed to the improvement of the diagnosis and treatment of patients with prostate cancer (PC). The study included 46 patients with recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy (RPE). The examination included contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (endorectal coil 1.5T) and hystoscanning. All patients had local recurrence confirmed by the morphologically results of transrectal biopsy of the area of vesicourethral anastomosis. All patients underwent high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). Before RPE, protate volume ranged from 21 to 102 cm3. The median age was 62 (46-68) years. PSA levels before a HIFU session ranged from 0.4 to 18 ng/ml. Nadir PSA level after 3 months of follow up was 0.1 ng/ml. Five-year disease-free survival in patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer after HIFU in the group of low cancer risk was 10 (81%), moderate risk--18 (57%), high risk--12 (42%). Contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and hystoscanning are highly informative methods for diagnosis of local recurrence after radical prostatectomy, and HIFU can be categorized as highly effective treatment.", "metaData": {"source": "Fiducial markers and their impact on ablation outcome for patients treated with MR-guided transurethral ablation (TULSA): a retrospective technical analysis\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34927517/"}}
