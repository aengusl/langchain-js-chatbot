{"pageContent": "The dog is a well-accepted model for prostate cancer in man because of the striking similarities between both species with respect to the clinical course of the disease as well as to its similar histopathology. Cytogenetic investigations of human prostate cancers has revealed the frequent occurrence of trisomies 7, 8, and 17. In this report, we present a case of prostate carcinoma in a dog characterized by polysomy 13 as the sole cytogenetic abnormality. Along with the known homology between canine chromosome 13 and human chromosome 8 these findings suggest that a homologous area on both chromosomes plays a crucial role in subsets of prostate cancer in both species.", "metaData": {"source": "Oligometastatic prostate cancer: Reality or figment of imagination?\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30521067/"}}
