{"pageContent": "Introduction: Reduced acceptance of radical prostatectomy in patients with low risk or intermediate risk prostate cancer has significantly changed treatment strategies in prostate cancer (PCa) during the last years. Focal therapy of the prostate with high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an organ-preserving treatment for prostate cancer with less impairment of health-related quality of life. Follow-up after HIFU therapy by imaging modalities remains a major problem as eg. MRI performs poorly. Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) allows to monitor the vascular architecture of organs non-invasively. However, only limited data are available using CEUS to define successful and complete HIFU treatment of the prostate. In this study, we aimed to evaluate short-term image findings using CEUS and image fusion before and after HIFU treatment.", "metaData": {"source": "Long-term outcomes of two ablation techniques for treatment of radio-recurrent prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32814843/"}}
