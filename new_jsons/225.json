Prostate cancer is now the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the UK. With this sombre fact comes a multitude of challenges and opportunities. I\u2019m Clare Delmar. Joining me today is Lorraine Grover, a psychosexual nurse specialist who for over twenty five years has been a passionate driver in helping to improve the way sexuality and sexual function is managed within health care. She has expertise in managing male sexual dysfunction and has a special interest in caring for patients diagnosed with prostate cancer and whenever possible, their partners. Sexual difficulties can have both psychological and organic causes, and she is able to consider both aspects of management. Lorraine has a diploma in psychosexual therapy and for several years worked in the NHS, providing nurse led erectile dysfunction clinics at St George\u2019s Hospital, London and Wickham Hospital, Buckinghamshire. She now provides a private consultation service to help men and women overcome difficulties with sexuality and sexual function, which she argues is too often an underestimated area of health care. If you haven\u2019t guessed, Lorraine is joining me to talk about sex. Lorraine, welcome and thank you so much for joining me today.Thank you, Clare. Thank you for the introduction. And thank you for you connecting with me.Yeah. This is, I think, a very exciting partnership because I know and we\u2019ve talked about this prior to this interview, how much our patients and their partners care about this. So, I mean, I think this is going to be kind of the tip of the iceberg, so to speak. But I\u2019m really excited just to sort of start this conversation with a few questions that I think would get people really thinking and really interested in pursuing further. So I\u2019m just going to pick up on what I mentioned about our patients, what they tell us, and just to make an observation that preserving sexual function is something that our patients, almost all of them care a lot about and voice to us. In fact, I would say it\u2019s probably at the top of their concerns, second only to preserving life itself. Yet they tell us that no one asks them about it or worse, that it\u2019s dismissed entirely. So what\u2019s your experience? What\u2019s happening here?Well, sadly, I think that is often the case, actually. Still is. I feel a lot of men have said to me over the years that they would rather be sexually potent, whatever that definition is to them and alive, being sexually active, than not being sexually active and having their cancer cured because of the effect of the treatments of managing prostate cancer, which is so sad to hear when actually if the subject was raised with them, they would know that there are lots of things to be considering about sexuality and prostate cancer. And I think we\u2019ve still got a long way forward. Things have improved to some degree. But what\u2019s so reassuring is the patients telling you and you reaching out to bring about change for them too. And the more we do that in health care, the better and also considering partners. So I\u2019m not surprised to hear what you\u2019ve said. I\u2019m really pleased patients are being proactive in raising their voice because that\u2019s how hopefully we will bring about some change.Indeed, but I would say when you say they\u2019re raising their voice, which they are, absolutely they are. I would just simply qualify that by saying it\u2019s because we\u2019re asking them.Yeah, yeah. And I\u2019m always banging that drum to health care professionals when I lecture, when I talk to them that we need to bring this subject up very early on in the patient\u2019s pathway. Right at the point I think of diagnosis.I mean, do you see any variation in your experience like anything that you could even categorise like some practitioners are better than others, some locations are better than others?Yeah, definitely.How would you describe that variation?It\u2019s been very much the surgical patient, the man having the radical prostatectomy historically will have some discussion about it\u2019s going to impact on your sex life and it can be as simple as that. And that can be quite shocking for the patient to hear and nothing else is discussed. The focus can be all about the erectile function. It\u2019s not just the only part of sex having an erection. And sadly, I feel oncologists don\u2019t always address sexuality issues. And so I tend to have seen more patients over my 20 odd years from the surgical background. And sadly, within focal therapy, there are very few patients that I have seen over the years. I\u2019m as interested to know from them when I do what their experience has been because I\u2019m learning all the time. We\u2019re all learning aren\u2019t we. We don\u2019t just assume, it\u2019s a closed shop of the information that we\u2019re given. Understanding the methodology about the treatments for prostate cancer and the impact on sexuality, this is important for us to know in health care as a professional as well as the patient. So I would say top of the league at the moment tends to be more the surgeons, but it can be quite matter-of-fact and doesn\u2019t really look at emotion and sexual wellbeing, it will be about functional outcomes.Yeah. So that raises another thought. Again, looking at the NHS, where you\u2019ve been a practitioner for many years and you\u2019ve spoken openly about the impact that prostate cancer has on sexual function, mental health and most importantly, sexual relationships. What\u2019s been the reaction to your approach?Some health care practitioners have welcomed my thoughts with open arms and embraced me and others have been very against me, I feel, which I think is really sad. I think that can be a bit of a power struggle for some people, and it\u2019s almost seen as letting go of patients, of their patients and actually no one owns a patient. A patient is seeking help from a health care professional. But there\u2019s many people involved with the care. And I have to say in the NHS, I was part of a multidisciplinary team, which I am now. But patients automatically got to see me in my clinic at St Georges when they were going to be having treatment for their prostate cancer. I usually saw them postoperatively, but all patients had access to me and I loved it. I really did. And in fact, I even saw patients with erectile dysfunction from a GP point of view, they saw me. So, it was quite innovative at the time back in the 90s. And I naively thought that, OK, when I ended up leaving the NHS, which was actually family reasons caring for my elderly parents who were ill, and I just naively thought that in the private sector these patients would be welcomed with open arms to have their sexuality addressed and I\u2019d be part of a team, which is what I love doing. That hasn\u2019t really been the case. I think practitioners are very individual and I like nothing better than being part of the team, because prostate cancer management is being part of the team. The focal therapy, you know, as we\u2019ve talked about the imaging, the position, all that\u2019s being done, what management plan the patient\u2019s going to have, what impact the partner has. I often say it\u2019s a jigsaw. The pieces are rather all tangled up in the box and we need to put them all together. And I think that\u2019s how prostate cancer patients should have their care as well. There are different aspects that our professional accountability allows us to provide and we should be sharing that and enhancing patient care moving forward.Indeed, I think that\u2019s absolutely right. And as I said to you before, I mean, one of the things that we\u2019ve seen with focal therapy patients is the very nature of the treatment invites these conversations with patients.Yes.So it\u2019s not a question of either or. It\u2019s a question of, you know, this is a treatment that has these benefits and these potential risks. And one of the benefits is the preservation or the reduced risk of any compromising on your sexual function or your sexual relationships. And that forces a conversation I find. At least that\u2019s what our patients tell us. I just want to change tack a little bit. I mean, it\u2019s just so interesting what you\u2019re saying. One of the things that I\u2019m aware of and we\u2019ve talked a little bit about is how many of the people who approach us well, in our case, about focal therapy, but I know in your case about sexuality and sexual relationships are actually women and the partners of men with a prostate cancer diagnosis who are searching for a treatment that won\u2019t compromise their sex life. And often it\u2019s the women who are the advocates or take the lead on this. And I often think these women are the forgotten protagonists in their partner\u2019s prostate cancer story. How have you been able to help them?Well, I mean, just giving the partner now, you said women, I appreciate that in heterosexual relationships, it will be a female partner. But I think same sex couples, the LGBTQI community, people need a safe environment to be able to talk about their sex lives and to be able to have that discussed with the health care professional. And so, as you\u2019ve mentioned women, I will follow that through that women having the opportunity to talk to somebody about the impact of prostate cancer has had on the man in their life\u2019s personality, their health, their fear, that opens up all sorts. It also allows a discussion to take place. And there have been sexual issues occurring anyway. It could be, I\u2019m seeing a patient in their 50s where their partner may be in the menopause or premenopausal or has had her own ill health, has never had an opportunity to talk about sex with anybody. And suddenly their male partner has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. And I\u2019m part of that team, hopefully, and I address it and they go, wow, I\u2019ve never had this opportunity to talk about things. So with women, I\u2019ll be talking about arousal, desire, lubrication, what helps them to reach orgasm. And sometimes the couple in front of me will have never had this sort of conversation. You know, they\u2019ve just been used to having sex in a certain way. There\u2019s a diagnosis and then it upsets the apple cart. So a lot can be done for the partner.And do you see that, I mean, just picking up on your point that in many couples have done things in your words, you know, in a certain way for a very long time. So do you think that this actually opens up new opportunities for them as a couple?Yes.For their own sex life?100 percent. I\u2019ve had couples go since I\u2019ve had my prostate cancer diagnosis, I\u2019ve now got a better sex life. I\u2019ve seen you, and you\u2019d never believe that, would you really now? I\u2019ve had people say I\u2019ve still got an active sex life since my prostate cancer treatment diagnosis 10 years ago because we\u2019ve changed things. We\u2019ve introduced things. I probably would have just thought sex has gone off our radar as we got older, if I hadn\u2019t had access to know about this information. So it\u2019s not doom and gloom. I always said to people, this is a recovery and discovery area for you, both of you, I need to find out what their needs are. Everyone\u2019s not same. You know, I certainly don\u2019t use an algorithm of A, B, C. What\u2019s happening for you now? What would you like to do? And sharing and being able to talk to each other. And intimacy, reclaiming intimacy was a great step in the right direction. We\u2019re not always on about things like vaginal penetration, getting a stiff erection, but rekindling intimacy for a lot of couples is something that is really liked. And it makes that journey for the individual with prostate cancer to feel the caring, the loving and open up these opportunities of discussion. So it\u2019s certainly not all bad news and the partner must be brought into the consultations if it\u2019s wanted, some don\u2019t.Really encouraging to hear that. I mean, I\u2019m sure our patients will be very encouraged and inspired to hear that. So what would you like to see changed in the way men are offered treatment for prostate cancer, given what we\u2019ve just been talking about? And how do you think this crucially important aspect of their lives and their identities can be better addressed?Well, I think often sex is the third thing discussed. It\u2019s the cancer, we\u2019re curing the cancer. And it\u2019s about continence and sex. I think they\u2019re all equally there, aren\u2019t they? That cancer diagnosis occurs, and you\u2019ve got to look at the continence and the sexual side of things together. And I strongly believe that going forward, that a sex therapist, whether it\u2019s from a background of nursing or it is a sex therapist, is part of a multidisciplinary team and that enables professional accountability, allows the language. I, as a clinical specialist in erectile dysfunction, years ago was running this erectile dysfunction clinic. But it became quite clear to me that the penis is attached to a man. The man may be in a relationship. The man may be in multiple relationships. We all have different sex lives. That actually, how can I empower myself to empower people to discuss this? Well, I need to get the training. So I hope that going forward, things like what we\u2019re doing today will make people think and think about their own practise and think about how they can improve care for patients. Hook up with sex therapists as part of the team approach. And don\u2019t be fearful of sharing the patient, whether it\u2019s in the NHS or in the private sector, with other members that can really improve the journey for that man with prostate cancer or that person, because we\u2019ve got trans people as well, obviously with prostates. And we should be looking at the whole holistic care. It\u2019s really important for patients\u2019 mental health, for their relationship, for their own sexual being. You know, it\u2019s part of within us, isn\u2019t it, being a sexual person. And that\u2019s not set in stone. It\u2019s a continuum. It changes in our lives with all sorts of things that make that change.Lorraine, that\u2019s all we have time for right now. But I really do hope to continue this discussion. And I want to thank you so much for speaking with me today. I mean, it\u2019s been such a pleasure for me. And I know that so many of our listeners will be really, really encouraged and inspired by what you\u2019ve had to say. So thank you very much.You\u2019re very welcome.Further information on Lorraine Grover and her practise is on our website, along with the transcript of this interview and additional interviews and stories about living with prostate cancer.
