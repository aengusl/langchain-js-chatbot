{"pageContent": "WHAT'S KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT? AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an alternative treatment option for localized prostate cancer (PCa), which is applied for over 15 years. There are conflicting recommendations for HIFU among urological societies, which can be explained by the lack of prospective controlled studies, reports on preselected patient populations and limited follow-up providing little information on overall and cancer-specific survival. We report on a large, unselected consecutive patient series of patients who have undergone primary HIFU for clinically localized PCa with the longest follow-up in current literature. Our results improve the understanding of the oncological efficacy, morbidity and side effects of primary HIFU.", "metaData": {"source": "MR-guided pulsed high intensity focused ultrasound enhancement of docetaxel combined with radiotherapy for prostate cancer treatment\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22217916/"}}
