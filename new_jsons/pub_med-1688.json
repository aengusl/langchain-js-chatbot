{"pageContent": "Goals: This paper is one of five interrelated papers about cancer, drawn from a larger study exploring the experiences of 66 people diagnosed with cancer. Findings are reported separately because the way in which people experience cancer can vary by cancer type. Here, we determine the utility of liminality and biographical disruption as explanatory theories in relation to men's experiences of prostate cancer. We situate and explore notions of liminality and disruption in relation to self, identity and context to inform debate about the provision of supportive care and highlight the contribution this study makes to the understandings of men's health.", "metaData": {"source": "The concept of erectile function preservation (penile rehabilitation) in the patient after brachytherapy for prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22330103/"}}
