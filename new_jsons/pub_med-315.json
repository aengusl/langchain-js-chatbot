{"pageContent": "Introduction: Focal therapy (FT) by high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an emerging option for localized prostate cancer (PC). Due to the lack of long-term data, a close monitoring after FT is essential, but there are still uncertainties about the optimal follow-up regimen. Here we report on a series of FT-HIFU patients with the focus on oncological short-term outcome and the value of postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate minimally invasive procedures: complications and normal vs. abnormal findings on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI)\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33977352/"}}
