{"pageContent": "The use of positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in prostate cancer depends on the phase of the disease along the natural history of this prevalent malignancy in men. Incidental high FDG uptake in the prostate gland, although rare, should prompt further investigation with at least a measurement of serum prostate specific antigen level. Although in general FDG uptake level may significantly overlap among normal, benign, and malignant tissues, aggressive primary tumors with Gleason score > 7 tend to display high FDG uptake. PET with FDG may be useful in staging of those patients with aggressive primary tumors and can localize the site of disease in a small fraction of men with biochemical failure and negative conventional imaging studies. FDG-PET may be quite useful in treatment response assessment and prognostication of patients with castrate-resistant metastatic prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9167480/"}}
