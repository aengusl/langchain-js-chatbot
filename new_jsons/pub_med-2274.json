{"pageContent": "Purpose: Studies in disease specific populations have emphasized disease specific quality of life with little study of general quality of life. Furthermore, studies of general quality of life in disease specific populations have mostly examined the importance of disease specific variables, and have generally yielded poor correlations of such variables and general quality of life. We attempted to model the emotional component of general quality of life in patients with prostate disease.", "metaData": {"source": "[Mass screening for prostate cancer in Tokushima City: the results of 2001]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15103922/"}}
