{"pageContent": "The treatment of localized prostate cancer remains controversial because of the lack of conclusive well-controlled or randomized studies comparing outcome of various forms of radiotherapy (RT) to radical prostatectomy (RP). We review recent results from an institutional database and prospective quality of life study comparing cancer-related and quality of live (QOL) outcomes among different treatment modalities for intermediate risk prostate cancer. The results suggest similar short-term survival but domain-specific effects on QOL after treatment with radical prostatectomy, brachytherapy, or external beam radiotherapy.", "metaData": {"source": "Loss of physical functioning among geriatric cancer patients: relationships to cancer site, treatment, comorbidity and age\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9616281/"}}
