{"pageContent": "Spirituality plays a powerful role in cancer treatment and recovery; it has been identified by hospitalized patients as one of their top priorities of care. However, health care providers struggle to find ways to address the spirituality of their patients. The purposes of this study were to discover what spirituality means for men with prostate cancer and how it influences their treatment. Eleven men, ages 54 to 71, with prostate cancer were interviewed within several days following radical prostatectomy with bilateral lymph node staging. This grounded theory methodology generated three categories of spirituality: (a) praying, (b) receiving support, and (c) coping with cancer. The basic social process, coping with cancer, occurred in four phases: facing cancer, choosing treatment, trusting, and living day by day. These results were validated by four of the participants for truthfulness. The findings of this study provide holistic nurses with knowledge and a midrange theory of spirituality that can be used in building a research-based practice.", "metaData": {"source": "Updating the International Index of Erectile Function: Evaluation of a Large Clinical Data Set\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31812685/"}}
