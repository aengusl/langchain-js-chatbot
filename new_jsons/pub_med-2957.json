{"pageContent": "In this review article adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies in patients at high risk for localized prostate cancer are presented in some detail. Adjuvant hormone therapy by antiandrogens as well as antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agents such as estramustine and taxanes are referred. Neoadjuvant therapies in addition to systemic therapy before or after local treatment for prostate cancer may improve the outcome of high risk patients otherwise destined to treatment fail. Data regarding some substances used in neoadjuvant therapies such as androgen deprivation therapy and use of rapamycin with its analogs, as well as some novel therapeutic approach strategies are also discussed.", "metaData": {"source": "A standardized analysis of the current surgical and non-surgical treatment selection process for men with localized prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29549504/"}}
