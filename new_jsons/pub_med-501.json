{"pageContent": "Purpose of review: In the absence of whole gland treatment for prostate cancer, both active surveillance and focal therapy share the common need of requiring a more thorough, detailed and precise analysis of the biological threats within the prostatic parenchyma if one chooses to monitor or selectively eradicate only specific neoplastic targets. In addition, focal therapy utilizes active surveillance post-treatment to monitor the untreated sectors of the prostate. We aim to evaluate the current modalities available to modernize active surveillance protocols in order to distinguish patients who may be safely observed from those who require intervention.", "metaData": {"source": "New technologies and techniques for prostate cancer focal therapy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29664243/"}}
