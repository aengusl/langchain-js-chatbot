{"pageContent": "Antiandrogen therapy is an important modality in the treatment of prostate cancer. Recent research into the role of angiogenesis in tumour growth and metastasis has uncovered links between antiandrogen therapy, radiation therapy and angiogenesis, which have exciting implications for the treatment of prostate cancer. Angiogenic cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have been identified in prostate cancer cells and tumours, and androgens appear to stimulate VEGF. This article assesses the antiangiogenic effects of hormonal therapy and assesses the role that angiogenesis may play in the observed cooperation between hormonal and radiation therapies for prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Active surveillance for clinically localized prostate cancer--a systematic review\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24610744/"}}
