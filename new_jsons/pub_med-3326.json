{"pageContent": "Recently, nutraceuticals have received increasing attention as the agents for cancer prevention and supplement with conventional therapy. Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and second leading cause of cancer-related death in men in the US. Growing evidences from epidemiological studies, in vitro experimental studies, animal studies, and clinical trials have shown that nutraceuticals could be very useful for the prevention and treatment of PCa. Several nutraceuticals including isoflavone, indole-3-carbinol, 3,3'-diindolylmethane, lycopene, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, and curcumin are known to downregulate the signal transductions in AR, Akt, NF-\u03baB, and other signal transduction pathways which are vital for the development of PCa and the progression of PCa from androgen-sensitive to castrate-resistant PCa. Therefore, nutraceutical treatment in combination with conventional therapeutics could achieve better treatment outcome in prostate cancer therapy. Interestingly, some nutraceuticals could regulate the function of cancer stem cell (CSC)-related miRNAs and associated molecules, leading to the inhibition of prostatic CSCs which are responsible for drug resistance, tumor progression, and recurrence of PCa. Hence, nutraceuticals may serve as powerful agents for the prevention of PCa progression and they could also be useful in combination with chemotherapeutics or radiotherapy. Such strategy could become a promising newer approach for the treatment of metastatic PCa with better treatment outcome by improving overall survival.", "metaData": {"source": "Outcomes of treatment vs observation of localized prostate cancer in elderly men\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17440140/"}}
