{"pageContent": "At the Utrecht University Hospital Netherlands the preliminary results of perineal implantation of I-125 seeds in patients with cancer of the prostate were evaluated prospectively. In the period from October 1989 to December 1998, a total of 249 patients with localized carcinoma of the prostate were treated with perineal implantation of I-125 seeds. Follow-up was every 3-6 months. Results regarding progression and complicantions were collected prospectively. Progression of the disease was observed in 54 patients: 13 died from carcinoma, 41 are living with proven relapse. 18 died from intercurrent disease. 25 developed a local recurrence, 22 a distant relapse, 19 patients only showed a rise of prostate specific antigen level, without further symptoms. Acute side effects from the urethra were observed in 22 patients: prolonged dysuria in 18, acute retention in 4 and urethral stenosis in 3.9 patients had surgical treatment of micturition disorders. Four patients suffered from reversible intestinal problems. Summarizing perineal I-125 implantation causes few complications and may constitute an alternative to external irradiation as well as to radical prostatectomy in the treatment of localized carcinoma of the prostate.", "metaData": {"source": "Use of the Gleason system in international comparisons of prostatic adenocarcinomas in blacks\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14716742/"}}
