{"pageContent": "Erectile dysfunction is commonly reported after radical prostatectomy. Besides the loss of erections, sexual life after prostatectomy is impacted by urinary incontinence, orgasmic dysfunction, and psychological stress. In this review, we describe classical medical therapies used for erectile function rehabilitation such as PDE5 inhibitors and injection therapy. A vast amount of data support the idea of focusing on restoration of sexual function on top of erectile function after prostatectomy. The important strategies described to rehabilitate sexual function include pelvic floor muscle therapy, couple therapy, appropriate preoperative counseling, and focusing on non-penetrative alternatives. A multidisciplinary approach and including the partner is important. Erectile function alone is not sufficient for satisfactory sexual experience and may not be used as a proxy for sexual quality of life. Adding full-spectrum sexual rehabilitation to a standard penile rehabilitation regimen has the highest chances of obtaining satisfactory sexual outcomes in men and their partners after radical prostatectomy.", "metaData": {"source": "Reduced radiation tolerance of penile structures associated with dose-escalated hypofractionated prostate radiotherapy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25440987/"}}
