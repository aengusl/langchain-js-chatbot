{"pageContent": "The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment. This review focuses on locally advanced prostate cancer and the evidence for treatment outcomes, both toxicity and efficacy, across the three major treatment modalities of external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and surgery. Only data that could pass contemporary quality metrics were used to form this report. This body of literature suffers from an absence of trials prospectively comparing therapies for efficacy and a lack of long-term prospective comparisons of toxicity. Upon review of these data, the authors concluded that there are several acceptable methods for the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer that is highly dependent of the patient's clinical (both prostate cancer-specific and comorbidity-specific) parameters at diagnosis.", "metaData": {"source": "Extended followup oncologic outcome of randomized trial between cryoablation and external beam therapy for locally advanced prostate cancer (T2c-T3b)\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22901586/"}}
