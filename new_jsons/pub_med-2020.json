{"pageContent": "Following tumor surgery, urinary incontinence challenges prostate cancer patients' functional health. Adjustments of functional goals (lines of defense [LoDs]) were examined during rehabilitation from incontinence. A conceptual model proposing stepwise and distinct upward adjustments of LoDs, ranging from minimizing discomfort (lowest LoD) to protecting self-reliance (highest LoD), was investigated. Within 7 months following the onset of incontinence, 175 patients completed questionnaires at 4 occasions. A theory-based hierarchy was imposed on time-invariant latent classes of LoD-endorsements. As incontinence receded, patients transitioned upward through the hierarchy of LoD-classes, matched LoDs to concurrent incontinence levels, and thus promptly claimed independent functioning with physical improvements.", "metaData": {"source": "The Eastland Prostate Cancer Survey: instrument development and psychometric testing\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23288607/"}}
