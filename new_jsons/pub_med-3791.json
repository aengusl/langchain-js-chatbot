{"pageContent": "Computed tomography (CT), MRI, and Ultrasound play an evolving role in prostate cancer management. Multi-parametric MRI has high sensitivity and negative predictive value in prostate cancer diagnosis, leading to increased utilization as part of an active surveillance paradigm in low-to-intermediate-risk patients, and local tumor staging in high-grade cancers. CT is modestly sensitive in staging high-grade tumors to evaluate for nodal, liver, lung, and bone metastasis, and is preferred for assessing treatment related complications. Until recently, ultrasound has been limited to a guidance modality for biopsy and treatment; however, advances in micro-ultrasound technology aim to expand its role diagnosing and managing prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Diet, nutrition, and prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9706231/"}}
