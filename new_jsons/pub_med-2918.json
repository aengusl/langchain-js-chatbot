{"pageContent": "This article details the methods of determining cancer-free status and addresses the long-term results of external beam radiation. It demonstrates that when similar patients are compared, the results of prostatectomy and radiation in early disease do not differ. The new technology in conformal radiation produces outcomes superior to conventional radiation technique in cure of cancer and reduction of serious complications.", "metaData": {"source": "A distinct repertoire of cancer-associated fibroblasts is enriched in cribriform prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33600062/"}}
