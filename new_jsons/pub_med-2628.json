{"pageContent": "Intraductal cribriform (IDC) and invasive cribriform morphologies are associated with worse prostate cancer outcomes. Limited retrospective studies have associated IDC and cribriform morphology with germline mutations in DNA repair genes, particularly BRCA2. These findings, which prompted the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for Prostate Cancer and Genetic/Familial High- Risk Assessment to consider germline testing for individuals with IDC/cribriform histology, have been questioned in a recent prospective study. A deepened understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving disease aggressiveness in cribriform morphology is critical to provide more clarity in clinical decision making. This review summarizes the current understanding of IDC and cribriform prostate cancer, with an emphasis on clinical outcomes and molecular alterations.", "metaData": {"source": "Post-Transcriptional Regulation of PARP7 Protein Stability Is Controlled by Androgen Signaling\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33572475/"}}
