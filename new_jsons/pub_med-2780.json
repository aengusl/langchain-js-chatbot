{"pageContent": "Although bone metastases from prostate cancer are described as osteoblastic, markers of both osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity are strikingly elevated in men with metastatic prostate cancer. Elevated markers of osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity are associated with adverse clinical outcomes in men with prostate cancer--outcomes including shorter time to skeletal complications, disease progression, and death. Bone marker measurement appears to be a promising method for monitoring the efficacy of bone-targeted therapy. Additional studies are needed to assess the potential role of bone markers in identifying men at highest risk for development of bone metastases.", "metaData": {"source": "[Oncological outcomes of prostate cancer surgery]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26519965/"}}
