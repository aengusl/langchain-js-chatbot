Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer amongst men in the UK and with this sombre fact comes a multitude of challenges and opportunities. I\u2019m Clare Delmar. Joining me today is Chris Lewis, founder and CEO of Chris\u2019s Cancer Community, an influential and impactful online community of cancer patients, recoverers and those affected by cancer. The community has a significant online following, including over 35,000 followers on Twitter. And Chris has shared his unique and substantial knowledge on the daily experience of living with cancer, with charities, government organisations and businesses both in the UK and internationally. He is one of the most knowledgeable, insightful and honest campaigners I\u2019ve met, and I\u2019m delighted to chat with him today about the current state of cancer services in the UK and what members of his community are telling him about it. Chris, it\u2019s so lovely to have you here. Thanks so much for joining me today.Thanks for the invitation, Clare. These are important times for people with cancer, and so this is a very timely thing. Thank you.Good, well, then, let\u2019s just dive right in. We spoke well, it\u2019s hard to believe it was a couple of years ago, didn\u2019t we, at the kind of summer of the pandemic, and lots has changed. So I guess I would just kick off by asking you what you see is the key trends that you\u2019ve observed through your engagement with patients since the pandemic.So, in general, Clare, over that period, there are two trends that I see. So there are patients that I speak to daily that have been diagnosed pre-pandemic, and there are the ones that are being diagnosed since the pandemic. And those are two very different groups, actually. And I was obviously one diagnosed very much before the pandemic in 2007, and myself and others, most of us in that group actually feel grateful, if I can put it like that, for being diagnosed pre-pandemic. Because what I\u2019m seeing now is that \u2013 not worse care, I can\u2019t say that \u2013 much more pressured care is now coming to the people that are new to the cancer diagnosis after the pandemic. The services are stretched. By the way, I\u2019m talking not just in the UK, I\u2019m talking about globally as well, but specifically in the UK we all know the stories, and they\u2019re not fairy stories, they are reality. People are struggling to get their appointments with GPs and that, for most people, is where their cancer journey actually starts.\u00a0But more and more so now, that\u2019s becoming A and E, which of course in itself is a very pressured environment. So it\u2019s very difficult nowadays for people starting their cancer journey. That is the reality of it, Clare.And do those with prostate cancer specifically show any particular trends. Any light you can share on that?Yeah, what I\u2019ve noticed, as you know, I speak from experience, actually, because I run a prostate support group and I\u2019ve done that for eleven or twelve years. And so there is definitely a difference to what has happened since Covid came. For the group, we started doing Zoom meeting so that the group had somebody that they could refer to over that terrible period. But that was very challenging in more ways than one because we found the numbers dropped off quite considerably. Those that joined us on Zoom, most of them didn\u2019t find it particularly appropriate for their needs. What they actually required is what we really know, of course, is face to face work. And of course that is something that\u2019s been eroded since Covid everywhere you go. I just mentioned about the GP situation, which is getting very tough, but also the time spent in hospital with health professionals. I think a lot of them are getting less than they actually need. They\u2019re getting the basics, of course they are. But there\u2019s a lot more to a cancer diagnosis, and particularly a prostate cancer diagnosis, than just letters and odd emails. There\u2019s a lot more involved there.Are there any examples or stories of people you\u2019ve engaged with around this that you might be able to share?Look, we all need time. People who are sick need time. They want to feel that they can share their issues. And prostate cancer is one of those where the impact of various different treatments can be very different. There are surgery, there\u2019s chemo, radiotherapy and so many different options that are available to some \u2013 some only have one option \u2013 but there are various different options with various different side effects and various different impacts which can last for life after prostate cancer. The big thing that I\u2019m finding really, is that people are not having these things explained to them well enough. I think the days of being a passive patient are well and truly behind us now. You have to really stand up and fight for what you want to know and for your own health. Unfortunately, the people that are quiet and this is why I do the work that I do, because not everyone is like me and they\u2019re not forward and they\u2019re not speaking up. Most people, they have great respect for their doctors and surgeons. That\u2019s fantastic. But time and money drive us all. And I can\u2019t necessarily say that people always might get the treatment that they actually might require.Yeah. And the discussions you have with members of your community often are aimed at just this point, aren\u2019t they? So that you can actually help them kind of almost be their advocate.Yes, particularly the group. That\u2019s why the group that I do is once a month, and actually that\u2019s the one thing that I\u2019ve kept up since I started all my work. The rest of it is all my own work if you like. But this is one area where I volunteer, because actually, online it\u2019s great, don\u2019t get me wrong, and I could communicate globally, but actually, when I see what\u2019s happening in my area, how the local GPs are dealing with things, how the local hospital are dealing with things, how the local health professionals are dealing with things, it makes it much more real.Yeah.When you\u2019re talking to patients eyeball to eyeball and they\u2019re telling us that they don\u2019t want to push for a blood test, a PSA test, their doctor\u2019s trying to put them off from it and that sort of thing you now.Do you come across that a lot? I mean, do you feel that even at that primary care level, and you mentioned PSA and specific to prostate cancer screening, do you think that there\u2019s more of that resistance to support men in that early \u2026?It\u2019s a good question. In the ten years I\u2019ve been doing it, it has improved. I have to say that. It has improved, but if I\u2019m honest, it\u2019s still not as good as it should be. We know PSA is not the test, there isn\u2019t the test that exists for prostate cancer, but it certainly can be a good guide. And so many people have got genetic relationships where they\u2019ve got their fathers and brothers and relatives that have had prostate cancer or breast cancer.Yes.And it\u2019s so common, right?Yeah, absolutely. You\u2019re very interesting point, because I think, again, in the case of prostate cancer specifically, the UK has been such a centre of advancement, both in diagnostics, obviously, around imaging, and in more precision led treatments like focal therapy, which we\u2019re involved with. Do you think patients appreciate this, that they\u2019re actually in this sort of centre of innovation for their disease? And do you think that\u2019s in any way something that would help them in sort of seeking more information or do you think it\u2019s kind of less relevant?Listen, progress in any cancer is absolutely relevant and we read a lot, particularly about prostate cancer, as you say. But if I\u2019m honest with you, it doesn\u2019t seem, when I read it, I like to read what\u2019s going on and I like to see any possible progress. I don\u2019t actually see that filtering down to the patients themselves, really. Nobody really talks about it. The patients themselves that I talk to, nobody really talks about that progress. I mean, everybody is concerned with what\u2019s going on in their particular case, what is available to them. I don\u2019t mean this in a horrible way, if you like, but what may or may not be coming down the track in five or ten years time, actually, is if no concern to the people that are struggling currently.We often get patients coming to us who have obviously had a diagnosis and a treatment offering or treatment recommendation, and on the latter bit, the treatment recommendation, they\u2019re worried, as you would expect, and then that\u2019s, of course, motivated them to go online or to talk to their friends or to just to seek further information. And so some of them who come to us are pretty well versed in some of these advancements and they want to understand (a) why they haven\u2019t been briefed on them, like back to a point you mentioned earlier. And then (b), how can they access them?Yeah, I mean, the internet is a wonderful thing. It can not be sometimes in health. But you\u2019re absolutely right, Clare. A lot of people do take to the internet and they read all sorts of things that actually, in many cases might not be appropriate for them anyway. There are so many different options now for prostate cancer, which is a great thing, but actually, we both know that not every treatment is available for everyone, and it\u2019s not always suitable for everyone. For many, there are only literally one or two options, which are the basics, aren\u2019t they? Either surgery or radiotherapy, chemotherapy or a combination of.Yeah. And of course, again, without opening this conversation up deeper, but at that point, if they were screened earlier, then you could look at more options, couldn\u2019t you? That, I think, is something we\u2019re all trying to achieve, is early detection. And in which case, the earlier you identify a man\u2019s prostate cancer, then the more options they tend to have in terms of treatments.That applies across almost all tumour types, of course.YesAnd you\u2019re right, that\u2019s another rabbit hole.It is indeed. And I\u2019m sure that\u2019s something that comes up a lot in the conversations you have with your members. Again, what would you say, then, is the good news here? What do you see as the real good news in terms of cancer care, cancer diagnosis, cancer treatment?General or prostate?Well, obviously I think our listeners are interested in prostate cancer, but, yeah, please do inform it by your other experiences.I wish I could say it was a lot of good news, actually, Clare, but my experience isn\u2019t good news, and I\u2019ve said this previously, that actually my experience of talking throughout to patients, to researchers, to clinicians, to CEOs, to most people involved in cancer, even politicians, right? Large charities, all of them. I can only say that the cancer world in general has regressed by approximately ten years, in my opinion.Do you think that the pandemic was primarily responsible for that, or have there been other factors?The pandemic was primarily responsible for that. But to be fair, cancer was, in my opinion, falling off the edge a little before the pandemic came along. No country was really as good as it should have been for the amount of money and time invested into cancer care or cancer research in general. Our success rates, inverted commas, whatever you want to define success as, is nothing in relative terms to the time and money invested into it. And basically now, of course, everything\u2019s moved over to Covid. And of course now all the hospitals are blocked, there\u2019s less money coming in, and cancer is no longer the priority it was. That is the reality that I see.I mean, it certainly is the headlines, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m very interested in hearing your views, because you can obviously dig a lot deeper than what the average person reading the newspapers can see. And it\u2019s interesting and quite sobering to hear you say this, that actually those headlines are not that far off the mark, I guess, is what you\u2019re saying.No, they\u2019re not. They\u2019re actually reality and they\u2019re not. To be honest, I\u2019m glad to see them, because unless we know what the problem really is, we can\u2019t solve it. Right? So all this waffle that we\u2019ve seen on health care, all these wondrous things, actually, I class that as like a thunderstorm, what you do, you get a lot of noise and a bit of lightning, but actually, sometimes it\u2019s rare that the rain actually reaches the ground. And some of these sort of things that have been talked about in the media for some period of time, the actual reality is that before it reaches the man in the street, that\u2019s you and I, there\u2019s a lot of water to go under the bridge.So Chris, what advice do you have for men who have recently been diagnosed with prostate cancer? Whatever\u2026 let\u2019s not discuss what stage, but a guy comes to you, he\u2019s heard about your community, and he says, Chris, what do you advise me to do?Pre diagnosis or?Well, I\u2019m assuming somebody who maybe just recently had a diagnosis.Okay. So my advice to anyone who\u2019s had a diagnosis of any cancer is keep shaking the tree. Chase your GP. Don\u2019t sit and wait for letters from the hospital. Chase the secretaries. Don\u2019t wait for scans. Chase, chase, chase.That requires lots and lots of energy, as I\u2019m sure you well know.Yes, it does. But to be honest, if we can\u2019t be responsible for our own health, we can\u2019t really expect others to be that way. That is the reality, Clare. Unfortunately. And that really is another reason why I do this work, because the days of the letters come in, the appointments come in, just naturally happening. Forget it. Most hospitals can\u2019t even answer the phone properly. Just try and ring a hospital and see what you get. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got much chance of curing cancer while we can\u2019t even answer the phone.But, I mean, you do find amongst your members that between you talking with them and them talking amongst themselves, that this can actually help to build a voice, build an advocacy role. Well, that is the good news, then, I guess, is people are taking a bit more control over their own care.I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve pointed that out, actually, Clare. Because that is probably the key, actually. Thanks for pointing it out. What\u2019s happened? Government. So I\u2019m not just talking about our government. Right? I\u2019m not party political. I\u2019m not politics at all. I believe politics is a hindrance to actually achieving anything in the world. And this, unfortunately, very sadly applies to most other countries with massive cancer issues, which is most other countries. Ten years ago, everyone talked about how America was wonderful. You could get anything in America, of course you could if you had the money right, but actually, nowadays, the likes of you and I, basic people cannot get cancer care, even if you\u2019re paying for it. Australia, America, Europe, Germany, France, Spain, all of them, they have all different systems to us. Whether you pay directly or you pay indirectly, cancer care is not on the priority list. That will not change for quite some time. And I personally believe it is the power of the patient that will have to change that. People affected by cancer. Let\u2019s be honest, the numbers are now 50% of us in our lifetime will be directly. So if you use just the figures in the UK, just the figures in the UK, we have 60 million people here and 30 million of us will be affected by cancer. That\u2019s frightening.Indeed.And so the fact that government are not bothered about it, the leadership of the NHS, they\u2019re just so flaky that they are controlled by the government anyway, so they can\u2019t do anything about it. GPs are under the same umbrella, they can\u2019t do anything about it. So the only people that can change anything is the customer, the consumer, ie. The patient.And that\u2019s what your community really exists to support\u2026100% Clare.\u2026and to advocate for. I could talk with you about this for much longer, but I\u2019m afraid our time is up and I think that\u2019s a good note to end on. And our listeners can be directed through our programme notes to your community. And I hope that you do see more people coming through to seek the support that you give so generously. And I really want to thank you, Chris, for speaking with me today. It\u2019s been very enlightening and quite sobering, but also quite informative. So thanks very much.Thank you again. Thanks for inviting us, Clare. We\u2019re all on the same side, aren\u2019t we?Absolutely.We\u2019re all links in that big cancer chain and we all just want to help people. So thank you very much for sharing my message too.Absolutely.
