Prostate cancer is now the most commonly diagnosed cancer amongst men in the UK, and with this sombre fact comes a multitude of challenges and opportunities. I\u2019m Clare Delmar. Joining me today is Alan Doherty, clinical director at the Birmingham Prostate Clinic and recently voted one of the UK\u2019s top 10 prostate cancer specialists in a national poll of consultant urologists published in The Daily Mail. Alan has been an innovator, advocate and dedicated practitioner of precision treatments for prostate cancer, and he joined The Focal Therapy Clinic last year to develop his expertise in delivering focal therapy. He\u2019s here today to talk with me about what he\u2019s learnt in the last year. Alan, thank you so much for joining me today. Hi Clare, it\u2019s an absolute pleasure. Let\u2019s jump right in because I think it might sound a little bit ominous to listeners that you\u2019ve only recently taken up focal therapy, but I think the whole idea is that you\u2019ve been leading precision treatments for a long time. And this is kind of like the frosting on the cake, as it were. So I\u2019m really interested in hearing what you have to say about what made you take up focal therapy with the dedication and fervour that you plainly exhibited in the last year. The question could be what are the influences which are out there which make people not look at this? And I suppose when I worked in the NHS as a consulting urologist at one of the biggest trusts in the country, the focus was was very much always to go for more established treatments like radical prostatectomy or radical radiotherapy. In other words, whole gland therapies where you treat the whole gland. And these are the sort of treatments that developed over a long period of time and really probably started when cancers were picked up much more advanced than they are now, because PSA wasn\u2019t being used 20, 25, 30 years ago, and so people would present with very advanced cases in at least more advanced than they are now and the treatments had to be more advanced. And that\u2019s where the word radical comes in. I think that you get a mind set, the NHS and the teaching that we had was all that, you know, if there\u2019s a cancer there, you either left it alone, which is sort of a bit illogical because why did you find it in the first place if you\u2019re not going to treat it? All you have to have is a discussion with a patient before you biopsy them and say, what would you do if I found a cancer? If the answer is nothing, then why would I biopsy them? But to the other extreme, where you say, well, if I find one and then we must treat it aggressively and achieve as high a curative percentage as we possibly can. It\u2019s sort of illogical, it doesn\u2019t really make sense because, not now anyway, because now that we\u2019re picking a lot of cancers much earlier than before, these cancers are often cancers that don\u2019t grow very quickly. They\u2019re often only in one part of the prostate. And treatments that treat the whole gland have quite a lot of side effects. And you think, well, why not just treat the abnormal area and then monitor the situation? And I think what\u2019s been a huge eye opener to me is that the mindset that comes with whole gland therapies is that it doesn\u2019t really matter where the cancer is. As long as you find a cancer, you can then just treat the whole gland. Whereas when you start doing precision treatments, you need precision diagnostics. And that means really high quality MRI scans and really high quality biopsy information. And it\u2019s just a completely different mindset. And I have found it absolutely incredible talking to colleagues who have been doing this for a long time, how much more information they\u2019re getting and they need to be able to advocate. And a lovely expression is with an MRI scan is can you rule things in or can you rule things out? And for that you need a high quality scan, so the machinery and the sequencing has to be good. And then you have to have a high quality radiologist who actually knows what they\u2019re looking at. And the variationhas been, I mean, amazing. I can\u2019t believe how much variation in reporting there is out there. Really quite remarkable to the point where you start doubting things. When you read a report, you think, well, is that right or is that wrong? There\u2019s a need to get this reviewed by an expert. Well, it\u2019s interesting because we\u2019ve talked before about variability and a whole range of the steps along the pathway. In fact, we recently blogged about it at The Focal Therapy Clinic. And I guess I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve seen that variability, you know, on the increase, as it were, during the pandemic. And I guess my question was, you know, building this expertise in focal therapy during the pandemic must have had its challenges. Is that one of them or are there others that you\u2019ve seen that\u2019s impacted your practise and your patients? Even though I practise in Birmingham, the radiologist that I really trust works in London with The Focal Therapy Clinic. And, you know, I\u2019ve been amazed that patients are prepared to travel all the way from Birmingham on my recommendation to have the best MRI scan around. And they do despite covid, they are prepared to do that, to go. So there is an appetite to be managed properly, even if it\u2019s to the point of travelling 80 miles to get the best scan. So I do think covid has necessarily impacted on my perception of how patients want to be treated and, you know, in some ways would allow me to do because we were a little bit quieter, is spend more time digesting the treatments and thinking about it and doing the treatments because. All this takes quite a long time to set up hospitals in the Midlands that they can operate, that takes a lot of effort. And so, you know, we now have two hospitals in the West Midlands which can offer this. And that\u2019s really been a great move forward and I think great for our patients. Do you find as well that the patient experience has shifted in that patients are more vocal about the side effects, for example, their sexual, urinary mental health? What do you think we can learn from them that will help us improve prostate cancer management for all men? They have to ask themselves, the question is how important is sexual function to them? Because if it\u2019s very important to them, focal therapy is probably the only treatment that reliably preserves sexual function. And although it could be argued that removing the prostate is a better curative treatment, some people are prepared to offset that slightly better outcome to maintain their quality of life. And that\u2019s the discussion, it\u2019s a grown up discussion to say what\u2019s the trade-off. And that\u2019s the discussion I like to have with people, because I don\u2019t know exactly what the trade-off is, but I know that that trade-off exists and people are prepared to take it. I think I would take it if I was eligible for that. But everyone\u2019s different. And so understanding different people\u2019s personalities is part of the management of this condition. Not everyone is the same. Giving someone the right treatment for them and informing them so that they\u2019re properly counselled as to what\u2019s going on is the enjoyable part of my job. It\u2019s also what we all want to see. This holy grail of personalised care, isn\u2019t it? Yes, exactly. In those conversations that you\u2019re describing with patients, are you seeing sort of a trend line of patients more interested in having that conversation and willing and able to to process that information and make the right decision for them? Oh, definitely. And it\u2019s very sad when someone is not eligible for focal therapy because they read about the benefits of focal therapy and they\u2019re so disappointed when they\u2019re not able to have them. And that saddens me in a way, because, well, had your PSA measured earlier and had you had this diagnosed earlier, you would have been eligible for this. I suppose the only upside if it, as it were, is that you point them a) in the right direction of treatment. But b) if they\u2019ve had that conversation about the side effects, they can take that with them and be a bit more informed when they go into the appropriate treatment for them. Well I think that\u2019s right. People like a realistic conversation and it is what it is. And it is always difficult to disappoint someone when they\u2019ve set their\u2026 Of course, but what is interesting is we often hear from men who will say, you know, no one ever told me but before that decision, erm so I guess in this case at least, having that counsel is informative. That\u2019s exactly right, yeah. It\u2019s you know, honesty, transparency is what people want and that\u2019s hopefully what we can give them in The Focal Therapy Clinic. So just because they contact us doesn\u2019t mean that they are necessarily going to be offered it, but at least they know they can have a very thorough consultation. Exactly, we\u2019re definitely seeing, that, in fact, you know, one of the questions I wanted to explore with you was just based on the observation that we\u2019re at such an interesting time where patients are getting more informed. I mean, you\u2019ve just described that a bit with your own patients and we\u2019ve certainly seen that. And equally, the technologies both diagnostically and treatment wise, are improving so much. So do you see that is driving focal therapy forward? What do you see as the future for focal therapy? I think we\u2019re going to get more and more consultants who have been set in their mindset, starting to open their minds to say, well, I get it now, because if we pick up an early prostate cancer, for example, instead of just monitoring it, why don\u2019t we just treat it? Because that\u2019s got to be better than just waiting for it to become a more dangerous cancer. Indeed A lot of our work is second opinion. So the consultants who are seeing them in the NHS will get to hear about the treatments they\u2019ve chosen and that will make them sort of interested in it. In fact, I\u2019ve heard of people looking at research into focal therapies with radiation, for example. And so the whole concept of a focal therapy is becoming on the agenda now. What\u2019s the percentage Clare now for London? I mean, the percentage of people having focal therapy for an early prostate cancer in London is something like 30 percent or something like that. It\u2019s quite a high number I heard the other day. It\u2019s remarkable how in London it\u2019s really taken off. And I think it\u2019s going to spread out into the rest of the country. I mean, again, there\u2019s that sort of patient knowledge enhancement part of it. More and more people doing their own research. And whether you call it Dr Google or whatever, I think there\u2019s, we\u2019re certainly seeing that because, of course, people find us by going online. So that would seem to be driving it in some ways. It\u2019s a bit sad that the patients have to do all this research themselves when they\u2019re actually talking to not only urologists, but also their GPs. You know, so at the moment, it is more patient driven. And I think what I can see it changing is I can see it being more doctor driven, in say, five years. Yeah. What\u2019s interesting about being sort of provider driven, as it were, is that these different trends that are driving that you\u2019ve mentioned a few patients coming from a second opinion and informing doctors, particularly regionally. But also you wonder from an economic point of view, patients who are treated with focal therapy and how that actually systemically impacts providers. The NHS for example, here in this country. But I\u2019ve never actually seen any fully costed study from a health system point of view on focal therapy. I wonder if that even exists. Well, no, nor have I. My fear is that it actually would be quite expensive. Maybe that\u2019s what puts the NHS off going that way, because what you have to remember with the focal therapy is that patients need monitoring and that requires regular MRI scans and good quality MRI scans as well. So, you know, it\u2019s not the cheapest of treatments, but in a way that shouldn\u2019t really come into it because it should be what\u2019s best for the patient Of course. But I mean, overall, you\u2019re very bullish about the future of this treatment, both from a provider point of view and from the patient point of view?  Very much so. And I think it\u2019s not going to be just treatments like HIFU that do, you know, there are new technologies because essentially what you\u2019re doing is trying to kill tissue where the cancer is. And it probably doesn\u2019t matter how you do it. The good thing about HIFU is, of course, is that it is just heat, you know, it\u2019s not long term effects from radiation and it\u2019s very controlled and it\u2019s safe. And so it\u2019s going to be hard to beat the ultrasound wave. I mean, there are other technologies using electrical energy, nanoknife and all this sort of stuff and cryotherapy. So there are lots of different ways to do focal therapy. But, you know, the HIFU is probably going to remain the main line focal therapy modality I suspect. Alan it\u2019s been really fascinating hearing your comments, and I\u2019m sure our patients will find this even more interesting, spoken from someone who\u2019s kind of climbed a very steep learning curve, but with incredible dedication and very clear engagement with their patients. So thanks very much for sharing that with us. Absolute pleasure, Clare. Lovely to talk to you as ever.
