Clinical studies have shown such treatment modality to be safe and effective in the management of localised prostate cancer as well as of local recurrences after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy.", "metaData": {"source": "Cohort study of high-intensity focused ultrasound in the treatment of localised prostate cancer treatment: Medium-term results from a single centre\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32701978/"}}
