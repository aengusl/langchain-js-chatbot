{"pageContent": "In more than 50% of the cases, the diagnosis of prostate cancer is made at the time of extra-prostatic or distant disease involving poor prognosis for cure. Small tumours for which curative treatment is possible are asymptomatic. Thus, useful early diagnosis of prostatic cancer is based on digital rectal examination and PSA concentration. PSA levels are also indicative of tumour volume. Thus, determining dissemination becomes significant only in the case of elevated PSA, indicating a large tumour.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24568399/"}}
