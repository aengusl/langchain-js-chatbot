{"pageContent": "The applications of combined MR imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging of prostate cancer have expanded significantly over the past 10 years and have reached the point of clinical trial results to test robustness and clinical significance. MR spectroscopic imaging extends the diagnostic evaluation of prostate cancer beyond the morphologic information provided by MR imaging throughout the detection of cellular metabolites. The combined metabolic and anatomic information provided by MR imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging has allowed a more accurate assessment of the presence, location, extent, and aggressiveness of prostate cancer both before and after treatment. This information has already demonstrated the ability to improve therapeutic planning for individual prostate cancer patients and shows great promise in the assessment of therapeutic response and the evaluation of new treatment regimes.", "metaData": {"source": "Neoadjuvant and adjuvant hormonal and chemotherapy for prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24188258/"}}
