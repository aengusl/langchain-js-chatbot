{"pageContent": "There is a growing need to understand how nutritional and lifestyle practices may optimize quality of life (QOL) and health after diagnosis for the 1.5 million men living with prostate cancer in the United States. We are establishing a clinical cohort of men with prostate cancer at the University of California San Francisco. Men completed detailed dietary and lifestyle questionnaires annually and provided consent for blood and tissue specimens to be stored for research if they underwent radical prostatectomy. We examined the feasibility of establishing this cohort and analyzepreliminary baseline data on participant demographics, lifestyle habits, and QOL using c2 and t-tests and logistic regression models. Between February 2002 and July 2004, we enrolled 343 men with prostate cancer into the survey portion of this cohort. The response rate was approximately 85% via in-clinic enrollment and 30% via mail enrollment. Based on analysis of the first 193 men enrolled, there was a high level of treatment satisfaction in this population (88% of men were satisfied or extremely satisfied with treatment) and positive reports of general health perception (73% of men perceived themselves to be in excellent [34%] or very good [39%] health). Whether treatment interfered with diet was an independent predictor of health perception and treatment satisfaction. Use of dietary supplements was high (90%) in this well-educated population. In conclusion, we demonstrated good feasibility for conducting this longitudinal study and observed initial indications that diet and other lifestyle practices were important predictors of patient QOL.", "metaData": {"source": "Racial Disparity in Localized Prostate Cancer Mortality\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28599761/"}}
