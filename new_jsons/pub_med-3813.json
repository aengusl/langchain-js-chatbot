{"pageContent": "Urinary incontinence is a common adverse effect associated with treatment for early stage prostate cancer. The influence of this factor on treatment selection decisions by patients and their partners has been explored only minimally in the literature. Data regarding the actual incidence of incontinence associated with prostate cancer treatment are confusing because of the lack of standardized definitions of incontinence. Radical prostatectomy is associated with higher rates of urinary adverse effects than is radiation therapy. Brachytherapy appears to be associated with a low risk of incontinence, whereas cryosurgery is associated with significant urinary adverse effects. Including incontinence, urethral sloughing, and bladder neck obstruction. The influence of these adverse effects on decision making regarding prostate cancer treatment selection is difficult to ascertain. Research indicates that both men and their partners appear to have difficulty processing information presented to them regarding the probability of urinary adverse effects and the degree to which these adverse effects may have an impact on their daily lives.", "metaData": {"source": "Beyond the androgen receptor II: New approaches to understanding and treating metastatic prostate cancer; Report from the 2017 Coffey-Holden Prostate Cancer Academy Meeting\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28925066/"}}
