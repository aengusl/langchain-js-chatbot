{"pageContent": "In many developed countries prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related death in human population. Prostate tissue is characterized by the highest level of polyamines among organs in human body, and it is even higher in prostate carcinomas. These ubiquitous molecules are synthesized by prostate epithelium and are involved in many biochemical processes including cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation and protein synthesis. In this review we made the attempt to discuss the functions of polyamines, their involvement in apoptosis and potential role as molecular biomarker for prostate cancer. Also we present recent data on generation of drugs, in particular, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, developed for therapy of prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Genomic tests to guide prostate cancer management following diagnosis\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28277880/"}}
