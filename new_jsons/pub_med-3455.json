{"pageContent": "Surgery remains a mainstay in the management of localized prostate cancer. This article addresses surgical aspects germane to the management of men with prostate cancer, including patient selection for surgery, nerve-sparing approaches, minimization of positive surgical margins, and indications for pelvic lymph node dissection. Outcomes for men with high-risk prostate cancer following surgery are reviewed, and the present role of neoadjuvant therapy before radical prostatectomy is discussed. In addition, there is a review of the published literature on surgical ablative therapies for prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Doublecortin Expression in Prostate Adenocarcinoma and Neuroendocrine Tumors\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32585335/"}}
