{"pageContent": "Much controversy still surrounds the diagnosis and treatment of localized prostate cancer. Urologists generally believe that early detection and aggressive surgical therapy saves lives despite the absence of confirmatory randomized trials. Furthermore, a recent survey of radiation oncologists and urologists revealed marked polarization toward their own specialties when asked how they would counsel patients on therapy for newly diagnosed localized disease. Some issues are not controversial, however. There is general agreement that pretreatment tumor characteristics, including serum prostate-specific antigen level at diagnosis, tumor grade, and clinical stage as judged by digital rectal examination, are important prognosticators for treatment outcomes independent of the type of treatment. Also, there is sufficient experience with standard therapies (radical prostatectomy and external beam radiotherapy) to counsel patients on the chance for cure and the expected incidence of acute and chronic toxicities. A comparative evaluation of various therapies for prostate cancer should include consideration of cancer control, acute toxicity, treatment-related quality of life issues, salvage of treatment failures, and cost. Within this context, we believe that newly diagnosed patients should be counseled on all available treatment options before embarking on a course of therapy.", "metaData": {"source": "Supportive care needs of men living with prostate cancer in England: a survey\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18506142/"}}
