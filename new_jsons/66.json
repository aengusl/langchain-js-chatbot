{"pageContent": "We don\u2019t understand enough about why some men, including black men, are at higher risk of prostate cancer.Understanding more about the genetics of prostate cancer will help us identify men at higher risk, so we can diagnose aggressive cancer earlier and save lives.\u00a0If you are a man of African or Caribbean descent aged 40-69 and haven\u2019t had prostate cancer, you may be suitable to take part in a study that can help us understand more about the genetics of prostate cancer.Interested?Email:\u00a0prostate.research@rmh.nhs.ukTel:\u00a0020 8722 4483Read more about black men\u2019s risk of prostate cancer.In partnership with Movember, we\u2019re funding the\u00a0PROFILE study\u00a0to help find out why black men are at higher risk of prostate cancer than other ethnic groups.The researchers are looking at the genes of healthy men at higher risk of prostate cancer, including men of African or Caribbean descent. Over five years, they\u2019ll monitor the men for signs of developing prostate cancer, using blood tests and scans and biopsies.At the end of the study, the researchers hope to understand why certain men are more likely to get prostate cancer, and whether one day they could create tests to help spot these men earlier, based on their genes.By working towards catching prostate cancer sooner in high risk men, we can increase the chances of curing their prostate cancer. And by understanding more about why and how they develop prostate cancer, we could work towards treatments that stop this from happening.The researchers are still looking for healthy men of African or Caribbean descent to take part. Find out if you might be eligible, and what\u2019s involved, below.\u00a0If you\u2019re not eligible, there are other ways to get involved.Share\u00a0with men who might be interested.Donate\u00a0to help us fund more research like this.Email:\u00a0prostate.research@rmh.nhs.ukTel:\u00a0020 8722 4483You can also refer to the FAQs below for more information, or speak to our\u00a0Specialist Nurses\u00a0if you'd like to know more about what taking part in clinical research involves.\u00a0To participate in the study, you should be:\u00a0If you decide to participate you will have annual (or occasionally more frequently)\u00a0blood\u00a0tests for a minimum of 5 years.\u00a0The blood test will measure the amount of\u00a0prostate specific antigen\u00a0(PSA) in your blood and can help indicate if there is a problem with your prostate.\u00a0The blood test will be done\u00a0every 12 months. You may also need to have\u00a0some other tests \u2013 an\u00a0MRI\u00a0scan\u00a0or\u00a0prostate biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0You may be able to have PSA tests at your GP surgery after the initial appointment if that is more convenient for you. Read more about what having these\u00a0tests\u00a0involves and the possible side effects.\u00a0A doctor from the Royal Marsden Hospital will discuss the treatment options with you. Read more about being\u00a0diagnosed with prostate cancer.\u00a0The team are following\u00a0both NHS and local hospital guidelines to keep participants safe. This includes PPE, temperature checking\u00a0everyone who enters the hospitals, and not allowing visitors\u00a0into the hospital\u00a0to reduce footfall.\u00a0They have also adapted the trial protocol in line with BAUS guidelines so that immediate biopsies will only be offered to men where there is\u00a0a reasonable suspicion of cancer\u00a0detected by\u00a0the MRI\u00a0scan. Those whose MRI is not showing anything suspicious will still be biopsied as part of the protocol, but when it is felt to be\u00a0safer for them to visit the hospital again.\u00a0\u00a0Part of the blood test will be used to look at your DNA (genetic material). The researchers will look at your DNA to see if you have any of the genetic changes that are thought to increase the risk of developing prostate cancer. These results will be kept strictly confidential and will not be shared with anyone outside of the research team without your permission.\u00a0The researchers may also test your sample for other genetic factors that are known to increase the risk of prostate cancer. Some of these genes are known to cause other cancers and can also be passed on to or inherited from your family members so can have implications for their cancer risk as well.If any of this type of genetic change is found, with your consent both you and your GP will be informed, and you can be referred to a specialist genetics clinic to discuss the implications for you and your family.\u00a0Having regular PSA tests as part of the study could mean that if you are diagnosed with prostate cancer it may be picked up at an early stage when treatment is more likely to stop the cancer and prevent it spreading.\u00a0There may be no direct benefits to you as an individual. But the results of this study will help researchers to develop their knowledge and understanding about the genetic causes of prostate cancer and help to identify men who may be at higher risk of developing prostate cancer.The results of this research may lead to new detection tests and new ways of undertaking prostate cancer diagnosis.\u00a0There are possible\u00a0side effects of having a\u00a0prostate biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0You may be diagnosed with a slow-growing prostate cancer that would never have caused you any problems, but could make you worry and decide to have treatment you didn\u2019t need.\u00a0Some people may experience anxiety\u00a0about the results of the tests but\u00a0support is available through our\u00a0Specialist Nurses. \u00a0The study team of doctors and nurses will be your first contact point for advice and support. Their role is to support you during and after taking part in the study. They will refer you to a nurse specialist or to a psychological counsellor if required.\u00a0Read more about what being part of a\u00a0\u00a0clinical study\u00a0(research) involves.\u00a0Call\u00a0our Specialist Nurses\u00a0if you are worried about your risk of prostate cancer or about taking part in research.\u00a0You can discuss this study with your GP or\u00a0 call our\u00a0Specialist Nurses.
