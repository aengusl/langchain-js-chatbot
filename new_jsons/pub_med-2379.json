{"pageContent": "Background: Afro-Caribbeans from Tobago are at high risk of developing prostate cancer. This elevated risk of prostate cancer is shared by populations of African ancestry living in diverse environments in the Western hemisphere. Variation in the ribonuclease L (RNASEL) gene has recently been reported to be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. However, whether RNASEL variation contributes to the increased risk of prostate cancer observed in populations of African ancestry remains unclear.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate Cancer Screening and Young Black Men: Can Early Communication Avoid Later Health Disparities?\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33689157/"}}
