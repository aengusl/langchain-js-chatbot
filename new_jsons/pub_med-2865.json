{"pageContent": "Multiple treatment options exist for men with non-metastatic prostate cancer. For nearly 50 years, external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) has been an important means of treating men with this disease. Improvements in technology and better use of pre-treatment variables including prostate specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score and prediction nomograms have steadily improved biochemical and clinical outcomes. This article reviews the current status of EBRT in the treatment of prostate cancer. Differences in technique as well as clinical results using conventional, 3D conformal and intensity modulated radiation therapy are compared and contrasted. The appropriate use of adjuvant hormones as well as the complications of these treatments will also be discussed.", "metaData": {"source": "Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer: Optimizing Patient Selection and Treatment\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30231388/"}}
