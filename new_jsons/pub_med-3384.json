{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer remains the most frequently diagnosed non-skin malignancy in male patients, still representing one of the main causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Evidence is mounting that suggests the putative role of microbiota in the carcinogenesis as well as in modulating the efficacy and activity of anticancer treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, targeted therapies) in a large number of hematological and solid tumors. However, few data are available regarding the interactions between prostate cancer and microbiome so far, in particular in terms of the impact of microbiota on disease development, pathogenesis, and response to medical treatments in this genitourinary malignancy. Herein, we provide an overview of current knowledge, novel insights and emerging therapeutic approaches related to gastrointestinal and genitourinary microbiome in prostate cancer patients, especially focusing on available evidence and published trials on this topic.", "metaData": {"source": "Survival after radical retropubic prostatectomy of men with clinically localized high grade carcinoma of the prostate\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8625082/"}}
