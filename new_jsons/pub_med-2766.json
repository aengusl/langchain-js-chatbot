{"pageContent": "The treatment of localized prostate cancer remains controversial because of the lack of conclusive well-controlled or randomized studies comparing outcomes of radiotherapy to outcomes of radical prostatectomy. A comparison of different therapies should include issues of cancer control, morbidity, quality of life (QOL), salvage of primary treatment failures, late effects, and cost.
