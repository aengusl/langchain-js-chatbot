This study was aimed at assessing whether smoking is associated with prostate tumor DNA methylation and whether these alterations may explain in part the association of smoking with PCa recurrence and mortality.", "metaData": {"source": "Long-term prostate-specific antigen velocity in improved classification of prostate cancer risk and mortality\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23398767/"}}
