{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer screening has resulted in earlier diagnosis with lower-grade disease, leading to over-detection and over-treatment in a significant number of patients. Current whole-gland radical treatments are associated with significant rates of morbidity. The high prevalence of low-risk disease together with an inability to accurately identify those men harboring more aggressive cancers has led to tremendous research in low-morbidity focal therapies for prostate cancer. This review summarizes the early experiences with focal therapy with emphasis on early applications of laser, high-intensity focuses ultrasound, and photodynamic approaches.", "metaData": {"source": "High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer: A Review\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28355119/"}}
