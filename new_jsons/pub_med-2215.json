{"pageContent": "A patient with stage D3 prostate cancer was given 11 separate doses of samarium-153 lexidronam (Sm-153 ethylenediaminetetramethylene phosphonate) of 1 mCi/kg (37 MBq/kg) in a period of 28 months for bone pain from metastases. With the first five doses, Sm-153 lexidronam clearly reduced his bone pain and improved his quality of life, as determined by pain-assessment scores and the patient's self-assessment of its effect on his ability to perform activities of daily living. With doses 6 through 11, pain at baseline was on average less, and as a result beneficial effects after treatment were not as apparent. Samarium-153 lexidronam produced transient decreases in the leukocyte and platelet counts, but these never became low enough to cause clinical concern. This case shows both the efficacy and the safety of Sm-153 lexidronam in repeated treatments for metastatic bone pain in patients with prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Hypoxia-Induced Reporter Genes with Different Half-Lives\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29858787/"}}
