{"pageContent": "Background: Men with West African ancestry living in Europe and North America are at higher risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer, are diagnosed at a younger age, and have more severe disease characteristics. Published reports present a conflicting picture of the disease in sub-Saharan Africa.

Our hypothesis was that black African men presenting to our service had more severe disease characteristics than other patients.", "metaData": {"source": "Quality of life: radical prostatectomy versus radiation therapy for prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7658548/"}}
