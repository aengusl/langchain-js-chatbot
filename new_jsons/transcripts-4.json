{"pageContent": " before we talk about radiation and sexual side effects I just wanted to let you know that we're having a live in-person conference and it's free we're going to be covering Advanced prostate cancer proton therapy and prostate cancer Imaging on March 11th here in Los Angeles if you're interested and you would like to come you can click the link in the description below now back to Dr Scholls [Music] so Dr Scholl's last week we talked about mitigating sexual side effects from surgery and today I thought we'd talk\n about it from radiation we have many requests for this so first of all can you explain the radiation that goes to the whole prostate and what the sexual side effects look like as far as the timeline goes does it happen you know right away six months two years what does that look like to us right it contrasts sharply with surgery which in which men get immediate impotence right afterwards and then slowly recover if if they're going to recover with radiation the onset of impedance if it occurs is delayed up to two years after the radiation is\n administered studies seem to indicate that if you get two years out from radiation and the shoe hasn't dropped and you're still functioning that your risks after that are the same as anyone in that age group as men get older they develop erectile dysfunction so that's just part of the aging process but it's not accelerated after two years so it's within the first two years there can be a drop off of sexual activity talking about erectile dysfunction with radiation or surgery it's interesting\n that in the prostate cancer world we only define erectile dysfunction is when Viagra and Cialis medication stop working the rest of the world describes it as impotence if you need Cialis or Viagra but in the prostate cancer world since there is a drop off in sexual function we're not calling erectile dysfunction if someone can take a Cialis pill or Viagra pill and get restored back to functionality so that's functional sexual capacity so we have to be careful about definitions also when we talk about this subject I'm glad you\n mentioned that because it's oftentimes I'm talking to patients even at the conferences years ago we'd have these intimacy conferences and they would say well my sex life just isn't what it was I had no idea I was going to have to take pills and something I've learned from you that you brought up recently so can you talk about the dosage of Cialis it sounds like you know some men get confused there's like five milligrams there's 20 milligrams there's a timing of it what is the proper dosage and the\n proper timing right it's worthwhile talking about this these are real Miracle medications and when they came out it was such a turnaround in the life of men because prior to the Advent of these medications people would have to give themselves shots in the penis which still exists and can help in Desperate situations where the pills aren't working but the proper use of the pills is as follows there are basically two popular generic medicines Cialis and Viagra there's some non-generic medicines like Stendra and whatnot but\n they're pretty expensive and to my knowledge don't really work any better than Cialis or Viagra the difference between Cialis and Viagra is that Viagra is given usually in 100 milligram dose an hour or two before sexual activity and then the medicine will remain in your system for about six to eight hours and then after that it dissipates and you if you want to be sexually active the next day then you need to take another pill with Cialis it can also be used out in that same fashion you can take a 20 milligram Cialis pill a couple\n hours before sexual activity and the duration effect will last longer it will last like maybe 36 hours and then wear off and and if you want to be sexually active say two or three days later you need to take another 20 milligram Cialis pill where people get confused is that Cialis is often prescribed on a daily basis so in that scenario men are given five milligrams every day and it builds up in your system so you get the same level as if you took 20 milligrams after maybe three to five days of taking the medication and I see a lot of confusion\n where men will get a prescription for five milligrams and they think well just take this on the day that I'm going to be sexually active and they don't get results because their dosage isn't big enough the daily dose requires five milligrams on an ongoing constant basis and then it will work as well as the as the Viagra does or the large dose Cialis does but it won't work well unless you continue it for three to five days so that the levels can build up in your bloodstream thank you for clarifying\n that when it comes to radiation how often are you seeing patients like what percentage of patients would you see immediate erectile dysfunction issues or how versus two years later well it's sort of a smooth Continuum so some men if they go through radiation they may start having difficulties with erections within a month or two others it may take 12 15 months the confusing issue about this whole discussion of course is that uh some men will become impotent after radiation and others won't you can take\n two 60 year old men perhaps neither is taking Viagra or Cialis at Baseline as men get older sometimes they're already taking these pills and one will become a seriously impotent the other won't have any problem at all so we haven't figured out why the the risks of erectile dysfunction or the occurrence of erectile dysfunction is happening in certain individuals and not happening in others we do know that if people are already taking pills or if they have pre-existing problems with erectile dysfunction that they're more likely to\n develop more serious erectile dysfunction than the person who at Baseline doesn't have any pre-existing problems in the video when it came to surgery we were talking about is there anything you can do before you get the treatment to help you know continue to mitigate side effects sexually is there anything you can do previous to radiation not that we know of there's been some talk about administering uh Alice on a daily basis there's apparently some sort of an exercise function that occurs with men's\n normal sexuality men will get erections at night while they're sleeping and this exercising of the muscles in the penis is probably a critical part of maintaining normal erectile function some have suggested that keeping people on Cialis during before during and after radiation May improve the long-term functionality that really hasn't been proven it kind of makes sense and it's a logical thing to consider I think it becomes an even more important consideration than the men that are doing hormone therapy because\n they routinely do lose the nighttime erections that are part of normal male physiology with radiation I'm not certain that taking Cialis when you quote don't need it if men are getting erections will make a difference in long-term functionality but I do believe that in men that have that in men that are undergoing hormone therapy that they will probably be better off if there on continuous Cialis and even make an effort to to be sexually active to try and get erections on a periodic basis because they're not going to be getting\n them at night time like their normal timing would occur if they weren't on the hormone therapy what is the reason the erectile dysfunction and the recovery of it when it comes to surgery versus radiation why is it so vastly different well of course in some men when they have an operation the nerves are cut inadvertently they try and do nerve sparing but the nerves are the size of human hairs and it's easy to inadvertently cut them so that's one reason that erectile dysfunction can occur immediately but we do know that\n depending on the patient's age and the quality of the surgery and and other factors that some men will recover erections over time the reason that is used to explain that never proven is that the nerves are somehow shocked by the surgery and that they go into a period of shock and it takes a while for them to recover and then men can start getting erections again and one thing that has been clearly shown in studies is that the quality of erections after surgery is diminished compared to the quality of erections after radiation and\n this has been validated in some very clear studies where couples are asked two years after after the treatment so there's enough time to recover from surgery there's enough time to become impotent after radiation so they either go through surgery or radiation and then two years later they ask couples a simple question are your erections the same as they are prior to treatment and unfortunately only about five percent of couples who've had surgery say that they're the same as prior to surgery whereas with radiation about 50\n percent of the couples say that they're the same as they were prior to radiation so we have whole gland radiation and now we're hearing a little more about focal therapy when it comes to prostate cancer well that help mitigate sexual you know sexual side effects is there anything that men can do to mitigate it besides vocal therapies when you undergo experimental focal therapy where they don't treat the whole prostate when you have surgery they remove the whole prostate with radiation standard radiation they radiate the whole\n prostate so when you treat a smaller portion of the prostate that there is going to be a better chance of not becoming impotent that is quite clear the whole field is poorly regulated and there's a lot of startups with laser treatments and high intensity focused ultrasound and cryotherapy even focal radiation therapy this great difficulty in figuring out who really knows what they're doing in this area but it's a logical thing to consider if someone has unilateral disease it's easily visualized on an\n Imaging study to just treat the tumor with a margin around it rather than treating the whole prostate and this is particularly important in men that are trying to optimize the you know maintain normal erectile function after the treatment so in our video in regards to surgery we talked about injection therapy to achieve erections is that something that also needs to happen when it comes to post radiation care if Men start to develop erectile dysfunction after radiation it's it's not the same mentality after\n after surgery if they've lost erections they may recover with time if men after radiation start to develop erectile dysfunction we're not expecting them to recover we're expecting it to be a permanent problem one rule I think for injection therapy in people that are having radiation is those that are getting hormone treatment at the same time that oftentimes radiation is given with hormones maybe less so now in this era of psma pet scans but still very popular and as we said before Men start losing the ability to get erections when\n they're on hormone therapy or they're just not interested I think since a man can develop irreversible atrophy during these long down periods without any nocturnal erections that it's quite prudent to think about doing injection therapy and these men that are that are undergoing radiation and hormones and who aren't getting any erections to consider Consulting a urologist to learn how to give an injection once a week to keep things functional until their hormone therapy wears off so where would\n when would you start that right away after radiation it's more related to the hormone treatment than the radiation treatment and I think it also would depend on whether these individuals are going to be on short term or long-term hormone therapy some of the new protocols with hormone therapy using Organics they're only on treatment for four months they can take some Cialis they'll probably be fine but some of the hormone therapies that are administered to men that have lymph node involvement they're going to be on treatment for 18\n to 24 months and if they're holding out hopes of getting back to their normal sex life they probably should be doing injection therapy during that long down period today we talked about the sexual side effects that can happen with radiation a couple of things come to mind first of all be bold when you're talking to your doctor about these things talk to him before you decide upon treatment what are going to be my sexual side effects and what's the game plan if those things happen I think if you've watched our\n other videos on you know sexual side effects of surgery or other types of treatment you realize that it's different for every treatment and even the timeline of when it can happen is very different so I think it's important to weigh your options and know ahead of time of what could happen so you can create that game plan talk to your partner and still have Intimacy in your relationship if you need help with your individual case you can go ahead and contact our helpline at pcri.\n org forward

Community is here with you and we hope you have a great week [Music] [Music]\nSUMMARY \nRadiation treatment for prostate cancer can cause delayed onset of erectile dysfunction up to 2 years after the radiation is administered.\nErectile dysfunction is not defined the same way in the prostate cancer world as it is in the rest of the world. In prostate cancer, erectile dysfunction is only defined when Viagra and Cialis medication stop working.\nTaking Cialis on a daily basis can help in maintaining normal erectile function, especially for men on hormone therapy.\nFocal therapy can help mitigate sexual side effects when treating a smaller portion of the prostate.\nInjection therapy can be considered for men undergoing radiation and hormone therapy who aren't getting any erections to keep things functional until their hormone therapy wears off.", "metaData": {"source": "Erectile Dysfunction After Radiation #ProstateCancer | #MarkScholzMD | #PCRI - YouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH8dYH-vjxo"}}
