{"pageContent": "Cancer stem cells have been defined as cells within a tumor that possesses the capacity to self-renew and to cause the heterogeneous lineages of cancer cells that comprise the tumor. Experimental evidence showed that these highly tumorigenic cells might be responsible for initiation and progression of cancer into invasive and metastatic disease. Eradicating prostate cancer stem cells, the root of the problem, has been considered as a promising target in prostate cancer treatment to improve the prognosis for patients with advanced stages of the disease.", "metaData": {"source": "Oligometastatic prostate cancer: definitions, clinical outcomes, and treatment considerations\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27725639/"}}
