{"pageContent": "The main goal of prostate cancer tissue biomarkers is to improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy. A particularly important question is whether the cancer needs immediate treatment or if treatment can be deferred. It is highly unlikely that a single biomarker that provides comprehensive prognostic information about a newly diagnosed prostate cancer will be forthcoming. Despite extensive research efforts, very few biomarkers of prostate cancer have been successfully implemented into clinical practice today. This can be partly explained by a lack of standardised methods for performance and interpretation of immunohistochemistry, but also by poor study design with insufficient biomaterial or inappropriate statistical analysis. Also appropriate cohorts to test prostate cancer biomarkers do not exist. It must be kept in mind that unsuccessful integration of new biomarkers in nomograms can also be explained by the good performance of the clinical and pathological base model with serum PSA as the only independent biomarker. A new biomarker must be powerful enough to improve this prediction model and not merely replace.", "metaData": {"source": "An Overview of Current Screening and Management Approaches for Prostate Cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26560323/"}}
