{"pageContent": "Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer in United States and remains the second leading cause of death in the Western world. Because the median age of diagnosis for men with prostate cancer is greater than 75 years, PCa can be considered a disease of the elderly. Several disease-specific factors (e.g., stage, tumor grade, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level) and patient-specific factors (e.g., age, co-morbidity, and functional status) need to be considered in the decision-making process. In an attempt to incorporate these important factors to select optimal treatment for older individuals, several decision models have been published, yet their utility in clinical practice remains poorly understood. Current guidelines for the management of patients with PCa do not make specific recommendations for the elderly. Clearly there is a need to improve our understanding of the complex interrelationships between old age, co-morbidities, and their impact on expected outcomes.", "metaData": {"source": "Measuring the quality of care for localized prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16006858/"}}
