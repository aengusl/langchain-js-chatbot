{"pageContent": "This study aims to determine if younger men, across racial and ethnic groups, discussed the benefits/risks/harms of PSA screening with health care professionals. Publicly available data were obtained from the Health Information National Trends Survey https://hints.cancer.gov/ in March 2019. Cross-sectional analysis of 518 men between the ages of 18 and 49 years from men who completed the survey between October 2011 and February 2012 (HINTS cycle 4) was performed. We used logistic regression to evaluate the association between race/ethnicity and discussions around PSA. Less than 10% of the participants reported a prior PSA; Black and Hispanic men were more likely compared with White men. Compared with White men, Black and other race men reported receiving less communications from some doctors recommending PSA screening (ORblack: 0.16, 95% CIblack: 0.07-0.38; ORother: 0.10, 95% CIother: 0.04-0.25), and that no one is sure PSA testing saves lives (ORblack: 0.49, 95% CIblack: 0.04-6.91; ORother: 0.17, 95% CIother: 0.06-0.48). Minority men, while more likely to have had a PSA, were less likely to be told of the harms and benefits of PSA testing, compared with White men. Increasing communication surrounding screening advantages and disadvantages between providers and patients can increase awareness and knowledge among younger men. In a post-COVID-19 environment, communication regarding the return to preventative screenings within vulnerable populations is an important message to convey. Research shows preventive screenings have dropped across all population groups due to the pandemic yet the decline disproportionately affects Black and other minority men.", "metaData": {"source": "Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20307026/"}}
