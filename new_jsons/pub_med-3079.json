{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is one of most common solid tumors in men and poses some of the most difficult problems in clinical research. Although many clinical research hypotheses in this condition have been explored using single center cases series and multi-center clinical trials, the results of these studies have often been equivocal, leaving many questions unanswered. Recently, investigators have utilized large, administrative datasets for prostate cancer research. These databases tend to include large numbers of patients from different geographic regions increasing their generalizability and statistical power. The goal of this report is to review lessons learnt about early prostate cancer using these data sources. In particular, we focus on the application of large, population-based datasets to address issues concerning the natural history of prostate cancer, the impact of race on outcomes in prostate cancer and the effectiveness of various treatments for localized disease. Information gathered from large, administrative databases will be helpful when counseling patients regarding their treatments options for localized prostate cancer and in identifying future directions for prostate cancer research.", "metaData": {"source": "Appropriate use of nomograms to guide prostate cancer treatment selection\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20141677/"}}
