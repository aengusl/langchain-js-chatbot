{"pageContent": "Introduction: Blacks have the highest incidence of and death from prostate cancer in the United States. Screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) may decrease mortality.

The objective of this study was to examine whether blacks were as likely as whites to report having had repeated PSA testing.", "metaData": {"source": "18F-rhPSMA-7 PET for the Detection of Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31836682/"}}
