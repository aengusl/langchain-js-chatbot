{"pageContent": "Exosomes are small membrane-enclosed vesicles that are released by most living cells and harbor a diverse array of proteins, nucleic acids, and lipid cargos. These exosomes offer valuable biomarkers that may offer insights regarding as a range of physiological and pathological processes, including immune responses, cancer development, pregnancy, and diseases of the central nervous system. With the development of high-throughput technologies, the vital functions of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been gradually entered people's vision and become new research hotspots. Nowadays, lncRNAs can play important roles in cancer progression by combining with miRNAs, activating molecular targets and other ways, and are also related to the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis for cancer, such as prostate cancer. Current review focused on the summary of diagnostic roles and mechanistic functions about exosomal lncRNAs in prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Sexual and reproductive issues for men with inflammatory bowel disease\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19223893/"}}
