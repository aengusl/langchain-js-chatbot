{"pageContent": "During the last decade, several new non-surgical treatments have emerged for the management of localized prostate cancer. External radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy are still gold-standard and effective treatments but often associated with morbidities and side-effects. Consequently, less invasive treatments such as high-intensity focused ultrasound and brachytherapy have been progressively developed in order to decrease the complication rate associated with standard therapies as well as developing an effective oncological treatment. Later on, concepts of << watchful waiting >> and/or << active surveillance >> have been proposed to decrease overtreatment for patients with indolent disease. Despite promising results, further studies with long term follow up are strongly needed to better evaluate the cancer control and the quality of outcomes afforded with theses new therapeutics and before considering to alter the current guidelines for localized prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Salvage treatment for radio-recurrent prostate cancer: a review of literature with focus on recent advancements in image-guided focal salvage therapies\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30977019/"}}
