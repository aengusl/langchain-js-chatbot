{"pageContent": "Purpose: Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided random prostate biopsy is, in spite of its low sensitivity, the gold standard for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. The recent advent of PET imaging using a novel dedicated radiotracer, [Formula: see text]-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), combined with MRI provides improved pre-interventional identification of suspicious areas. This work proposes a multimodal fusion image-guided biopsy framework that combines PET-MRI images with TRUS, using automatic segmentation and registration, and offering real-time guidance.", "metaData": {"source": "[High-intensity focused ultrasound]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22338724/"}}
