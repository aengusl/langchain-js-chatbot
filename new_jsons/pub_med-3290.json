{"pageContent": "Background: Accumulating evidence indicates that oestrogens have significant direct effects on normal prostate development and carcinogenesis. The majority of the biological activities of oestrogens are mediated through the oestrogen receptor (ER), which functions as a hormone-inducible transcription factor to regulate target gene expression by binding to oestrogen response elements (EREs) in the regulatory regions of target genes. Sequence variants in EREs might affect the ER-ERE interaction and subsequent physiological activities. Therefore, we tested whether common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) inside EREs are related to the clinical outcomes of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Alternatives to whole gland treatment for localized prostate cancer: a review of novel focal therapies\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35552305/"}}
