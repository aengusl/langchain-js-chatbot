It also includes recommendations on follow-up in primary care for people diagnosed with prostate cancer.\u00a0A table of NHS England interim treatment regimens\u00a0gives possible alternative treatment options for use during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce infection risk. This may affect decisions for patients with prostate cancer. See the\u00a0COVID-19 rapid guideline: delivery of systemic anticancer treatments\u00a0for more details.In December 2021, we reviewed the evidence and updated the recommendations on risk stratification to refer to a 5-tier model. Other recommendations were amended to reflect this change. For more information, see the update information.This guideline includes recommendations on:March 2023: We have found no new evidence that affects the recommendations. For more information, see the surveillance decision.How we develop NICE guidelinesThis guideline updates and replaces NICE guideline CG175 (January 2014), NICE diagnostics guidance 17 (June 2015), and evidence summaries ESNM30 and ESUOM50.The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service. It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian.All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.Local commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with complying with those duties.Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.\u00a9 NICE 2023.
