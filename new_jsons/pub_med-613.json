{"pageContent": "The accuracy of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) lesion prediction modelling was evaluated for a truncated spherical transducer designed for prostate cancer treatment The modelling adapted the bio heat transfer equation (BHTE) to take into account the activity of cavitation bubbles generated during HIFU exposure. This modelling was used to predict the lesions produced by three different transducer geometries: fixed-focus, concentric-ring and 1.5D phased-array. Lesions were predicted for different ultrasound exposure conditions close to those used in prostate cancer treatment. Twenty-one in vitro and nine in vitro experiments were performed on pig liver to validate the accuracy of the predictions. A good match was found between the predicted and experimental lesion shapes. Lesion dimensions (maximum depth and length, area at the centre of the lesion or central surface area) were measured on experimental and predicted lesions. The central surface area was predicted by the model with a range of error of 0.15-6.5% for in vitro tests and 0.97-9% in vivo. For comparison, BHTE without bubbles had a range of error of 0.4-55.5% (in vitro) and 9-25.5% (in vivo). The model should be accurate enough to predict HIFU lesions under ultrasound exposure conditions used in prostate cancer treatment.", "metaData": {"source": "The status of high-intensity focused ultrasound in the treatment of localized prostate cancer and the impact of a combined resection\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12756090/"}}
