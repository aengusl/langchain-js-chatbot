{"pageContent": "The increase in the number of prostate cancer survivors and their relatively young age has prompted many urologists to concentrate on early penile rehabilitation to improve potency rates following radical prostatectomy. Positive results from various procedures range from 14% to 81% following bilateral nerve-sparing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, to 43% to 97% following robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. An early program with an erectaid improves erectile physiology and performance and logistically, the combination of a 5-phosphodiesterase inhibitor and a vacuum constriction device may prove to be the most user-friendly, cost-effective, and patient-compliant. Other issues that affect patient compliance, such as loss of interest and fear of undertaking sexual activity, will only be revealed through long-term patient follow-up and care.", "metaData": {"source": "The effect of comorbidity and socioeconomic status on sexual and urinary function and on general health-related quality of life in men treated with radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18371045/"}}
