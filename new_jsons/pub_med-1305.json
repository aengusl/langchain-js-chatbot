{"pageContent": "Erectile difficulties are common after prostate cancer (PCa) treatment and are associated with sexual distress. However, the relationship between erectile function and sexual distress has yet to be carefully examined. This study had three goals: (1) examine the relationship between erectile function and sexual distress; (2) determine groups of men based on erectile function and sexual distress; and (3) examine the psychosexual characteristics of these groups. A cross section of 233 sexually active men after PCa treatment (age M = 64.90 years, SD = 7.50) completed an online survey containing demographic, health, and sexuality and relationship questionnaires. The relationship between erectile function and sexual distress was curvilinear. Four groups of men were found: good erectile function and low sexual distress, poor erectile function and high sexual distress, but also good erectile function yet high sexual distress, and poor erectile function and low sexual distress. Regardless of erectile function, men with greater sexual distress were more depressed, reported additional sexual concerns, placed less value on sex, were less sexually satisfied, and used protective buffering communication more frequently. They were also less likely to be satisfied with their adaptation to sexual changes and less likely to have found a solution to those changes. The relationship between erectile function and sexual distress is complex, characterized by a wide array of responses to erectile function (high and low distress) and multiple correlates of sexual distress. These results broaden the concept of sexual recovery after PCa treatment, which may assist clinicians and researchers to better address sexual problems after PCa treatment.", "metaData": {"source": "Dissociation between patients and their partners in expectations for sexual life after radical prostatectomy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23293937/"}}
