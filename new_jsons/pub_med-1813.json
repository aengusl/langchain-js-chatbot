{"pageContent": "This study aims to examine racial differences in all-cause mortality between African American (AA) and non-African American localized prostate cancer patients. This study advances academic discussion by being among the first to use a sample more representative of the general population that is different from certain subpopulations examined in literature. This study adopted a retrospective cohort study design using the Florida Cancer Data System. The hierarchical logistic regression was employed to analyze mortality in 2004 among living patients with localized prostate cancer from baseline 2000. Among 9617 patients, the odds of mortality in AAs were 57.6% higher than the non-AAs (Adjusted OR = 1.576, 95% CI: 1.243-1.999). Among prostate cancer patients, AA, older age, unmarried status, conservative treatment, Medicaid, and tumor grade III diagnosis predicted higher mortality relative to the reference group. Screening programs at a younger age can be considered, family and community support and aggressive treatments are suggested to prevent AA against adverse health outcomes.", "metaData": {"source": "Complications of androgen deprivation therapy in men with prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15066232/"}}
