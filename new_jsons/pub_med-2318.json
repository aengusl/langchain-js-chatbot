{"pageContent": "Background: For over 15 years, studies have been done to evaluate the elimination kinetics of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after radical prostatectomy. Even though evaluation of PSA regression in the two-compartment model has become established, no clear data are currently available as to whether a statement can be made with regard to tumor prognosis from a computation of the PSA half-life (PSA-HL). This study focuses on the determination of the PSA-HL in the two-compartment model and on its correlation with the biochemical recurrence-free survival. In addition, a computer program is being developed to simplify the determination of PSA-HL.", "metaData": {"source": "Oldest known case of metastasizing prostate carcinoma diagnosed in the skeleton of a 2,700-year-old Scythian king from Arzhan (Siberia, Russia)\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17918181/"}}
