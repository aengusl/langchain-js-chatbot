{"pageContent": "Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common non-skin cancer among men in developed countries. Several novel treatments have been adopted by healthcare systems to manage PCa. Most of the observational studies and randomized trials on PCa have concurrently evaluated fewer treatments over short follow-up. Further, preceding decision analytic models on PCa management have not evaluated various contemporary management options. Therefore, a contemporary decision analytic model was necessary to address limitations to the literature by synthesizing the evidence on novel treatments thereby forecasting short and long-term clinical outcomes.", "metaData": {"source": "The Prostate Cancer DREAM Challenge: A Community-Wide Effort to Use Open Clinical Trial Data for the Quantitative Prediction of Outcomes in Metastatic Prostate Cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25777346/"}}
