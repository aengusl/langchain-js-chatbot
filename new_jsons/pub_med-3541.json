{"pageContent": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 170 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) associated with prostate cancer risk. Each variant is associated with only small increases in risk and is not predictive of an individuals' overall risk of developing prostate cancer. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) combining these variants are now clinically available and may improve predictive value of other factors such as PSA. This overview reviews the current state of PRS for prostate cancer including testing considerations.", "metaData": {"source": "Radical prostatectomy in high-risk prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23305529/"}}
