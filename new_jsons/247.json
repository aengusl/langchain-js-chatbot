Prostate cancer is now the most commonly diagnosed cancer amongst men in the UK, and with this sombre fact comes a multitude of challenges and opportunities. I\u2019m Clare Delmar. Joining me today is GP and men\u2019s health specialist Dr. Jeff Foster, author of Man Alive, in which he examines the most commonly misunderstood aspects of men\u2019s health. His expertise on testosterone deficiency, erectile dysfunction, prostate health, cardiovascular disease and nutrition and wellness has been shared widely through media and applied in his clinical practise. Dr. Foster, thank you so much for coming today and welcome to OnFocus.Thanks very much for having me.One of the things that introduced me to you was obviously your book, which we can talk a little bit about later. But you recently had a piece in The Times which got a lot of attention where you talked about screening for prostate health, screening for prostate cancer specifically. And I wanted to just sort of start off on that and ask what your observations have been over the last 18 months during the pandemic on screening for prostate cancer. And why you think this is important? What\u2019s changed and what do you think men can anticipate going forward?Yeah, sure. So at the initial start of the pandemic, the uptake in all forms of screening and almost all primary health care just stopped almost dead to the point where it would probably be the first time since I qualified that we had clinics and you would have space and there was time and no one actually came in asking a question. And this lasted through the initial period where everything stayed very calm. And then, of course, there\u2019s a degree of acceptance and understanding about what was happening. And then gradually people\u2019s health needs, health anxieties started to go back up again. And now we\u2019re seeing the opposite. And it\u2019s the rebound effect because in a lot of these scenarios, the end result in terms of patient user demand works out the same, except we\u2019ve got a big gap where nothing happened so suddenly we\u2019re now trying to cram all that stuff back into the same amount of working day, which means obviously it\u2019s a big challenge to do.And how does that play out with screening for prostate cancer and specifically around PSA testing?The big thing for PSA testing, from my perspective, is that it\u2019s how you use the PSA that\u2019s important. And we regularly, I would say our practice has just short of sixteen thousand patients in the NHS practice, we would have maybe one or two patients a week who would just request to have a PSA test. They wouldn\u2019t necessarily want to see a doctor to discuss that, but would just send an e-consult or a medication request and on that would say, can I just book for a PSA test?OKThese are not the same guys that have symptoms and these are not the same guys that are already under urology or may have other urological problems. But just that understanding that some people know about PSA, they\u2019ve heard of it and they think I just want it tested. The problem that we have is that obviously you then say to your patient, well the PSA is not a widely accepted national screening tool for all forms of prostate cancer. It doesn\u2019t work that well. But on the other hand, you also say, but on the other hand, it\u2019s the best we\u2019ve got for now. So you have to have this middle ground. You have to really counsel every patient to say, what is your risk, your age group, what is your expected level of PSA? And then you can start to give them a bit of informed choice about what they want to do with that test and whether it\u2019s going to be useful, and even if they do have it. What do you do with that result in maybe six months a year, five years time.But you made a comment a minute ago about what your expected PSA. I think that\u2019s how you phrased it. I mean, do you see a point where every man should have a baseline PSA and then they maybe eventually begin to self track?A single PSA by itself I would consider to be useless. And obviously, as part of the book we spoke to several urologists about this and there is so much discussion around when and at what point we should start looking at people\u2019s PSAs. I think a PSA is very useful if it\u2019s initially screened properly and then it\u2019s used cumulatively. And the whole thing about medicine now, it\u2019s moving away from subjective feelings and symptoms of disease. And we\u2019re looking to gain as much objective data as possible. And patients want to see their PSAs. And if you can say I\u2019ve got a guy\u2019s PSA every six months for five years, then that\u2019s useful data. And you can do something with that.Yeah, but I guess that\u2019s what I meant when I suggested self-monitoring or self tracking. I mean, do you foresee a point where you have your initial baseline done through a GP like yourself, but then you are able to monitor regularly whatever period that regularity is, Do you see, that is something in the future?Probably not, to be honest, purely because again, there are too many variables around the local labs and what their PSA might be. How do you reliably get your patient to get from\u2026. If they are not getting it from primary care, where are they getting the PSA from? Who\u2019s responsible for that test if it comes back abnormal, if you didn\u2019t order it?Indeed.Is there anything better than a PSA you could use that more to fill that gap.Well, I\u2019m going to come on to that, that you raised a really interesting point and I am going to come on to that. But again, you use the word variability, and that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been looking at a lot because we hear about it so much from our patients who, again, you talk about data, you know, we can track patients who have had such variable experiences across the NHS, whether it\u2019s from different parts of the country. And I guess that\u2019s something that I wanted to explore a little bit with you, that this variability in both the screening and in the diagnostic pathway that follows. How do you think this can be addressed in the sort of medium term and ultimately in the longer term? Because it can\u2019t stay that way, if one person gets tested one way and has a different type of biopsy or a different type of imaging or different type of treatment. How do you see that playing out?The inherent problem with the pathway is the PSA itself. So if you are to compare, for example, with breast screening, a patient has a mammogram, based on that result, it then goes to a specialist who will then review patients. The follow up process is very, very clear. And the operating procedures are so well established, you can apply them to a national accepted screening process. If you have a test like PSA, which no one really agrees what use it really is, then you can\u2019t apply a very well-regulated process to go with it. There\u2019s rough processes and NICE guidance and two week criteria still fits and if you\u2019ve got some enormous PSA you can just refer your patient. But of course there\u2019s so many variables around that. I mean not everyone get referred and some hospitals will run the results of those PSA differently to others.So now, I do want to come back to your point you made earlier about the PSA being that the best we have, I think, is how you expressed it. You know, amid this kind of controversy, we\u2019ve actually begun to see a new approach in imaging that\u2019s emerging that it could be used for screening. And in fact, you mentioned mammogram is already being compared to a mammogram. In fact, it\u2019s being called the prostagram. Do you see a role for this in primary care in future?If you could devise a screening test that was cheap, reliable and minimally invasive and you could get men to engage with that, then it would easily surpass the PSA. And if you could have a national screening prostagram service or something similar comparable to cervical screening or breast screening, and it allowed men to be walking in for a quick image which was non-invasive, had a very good pick up rate and was relatively cheap to do, then we could get rid of PSA as a screening tool in primary care completely.Are you familiar with the prostagram? In its current form it\u2019s still being trialled.Yeah, and the problems with it at the minute would be the cost is too prohibitive. You couldn\u2019t use that as a GP referral source because everything we have to do has to be justifiable in primary care. It\u2019s a very odd scenario, whereas if you\u2019re a hospital doc and you work in the hospital, for the majority, 99 percent of stuff, you can just test for it if you need it, there\u2019s no look at the budget. Whereas in primary care, you are budgeted on everything you do. And if you over investigate, you are penalised for it.Interesting. Gosh, I could talk about this one for a while, but I won\u2019t. I want to come back to, again, something you referred to earlier, which is around data. There\u2019s been a lot of discussion around how the NHS is using patient data and particularly GP records. What are your views on this and how do you see the NHS data being used to support and advance men\u2019s health?It\u2019s all about what you feel you want your data to be used for and what understanding you have in terms of what your data offers. So to clarify, what I mean is, a lot of people are very fearful of giving their NHS data out, as if in some way this is going to impact on their ability to function in life, as if in some way this is personalised stuff that we don\u2019t want Big Brother to know, that sort of thing is very hidden. Whereas actually what we\u2019re finding also as we move to the electronic system of prescribing and hospital sharing of notes, is that actually data in the NHS is not particularly well protected anyway, and it is shared amongst various groups within the NHS quite freely. If you then say you want to sell it on to third parties, well of course that has to be with the explicit consent of the patient because you\u2019re crossing that that boundary from what is NHS agreed. When you signed up to this, you agreed to do that. Well, actually, I might have BUPA, Virgin, Nuffield, any secondary company might decide, actually, they\u2019ve got your data and they might be able to advertise something to you. Now, if this is the way that the NHS could fund its shortfall, then perhaps people might agree. And it might be a very easy way of plugging a financial gap that\u2019s badly required. On the other hand, people are also very protective of the NHS and the NHS data, and they feel that their health records are very personal to them. So I think you probably could do it and you probably could do it quite successfully. But I think the way it\u2019s been done almost surreptitiously and with a lot of behind closed doors sort of feel behind it has meant that for many patients it has not been a very positive experience into the data sharing.Which is such a shame. If we could square the circle, because, as you said, it potentially plugs a financial shortfall. But also, as we\u2019ve seen during the pandemic, when clinical trials themselves are being compromised, data has become the way we actually do our studies and look at how we actually will advance various problems in health care. I mean, so you\u2019ve got this resource, but somehow it\u2019s kind of stuck.Yes, I totally agree. And the bigger issues around this are that firstly data in the NHS is not linked. So, for example, patients always imagine that the hospital guys can see what we write in our electronic notes, which they can\u2019t. And the hospital also imagine that the district nurses can see what I write in the notes, but they can\u2019t. And this kind of separated piles of data, the amount of information out there is just unbelievable. And if it was more readily available, the difficulty behind research would be surmounted so much more easily.Well, again, this is something that\u2019s going to, I think, plough on and on. And I guess at the end of the summer, we\u2019ll see what kind of decision gets made on that. So just to close out, pull this back down to the patient level, so to speak, and that Times article that I referenced earlier was quite popular. And I\u2019m really interested to hear what you have to say about how you would advise men, you know, at certain benchmarks, 40, 50, 60, and what the top thing is they could do in managing their prostate health.I think the best thing you can do is don\u2019t just focus on your prostate and to focus on any gland, any organ, any specific item in your body is the route to failure. Because if you are truly interested in men\u2019s health and you\u2019re interested in your own body and you\u2019re interested in getting better quality of life, then you want to focus on your entire self, this holistic idea. So you would always say to every patient, when you\u2019re 40, 50 and 60, you want to get a full blown health check and you want to look for everything that you can try and look for in terms of disease risk profiling. The reason that\u2019s important in terms of looking at prostate health is because it has ramifications. So if, for example, you pick up one form of disease that may have implications on your overall prostate disease or prostate cancer risk, for example, there\u2019s tenuous evidence, or slightly better evidence suggests that vitamin D supplementation could reduce your risk of prostate cancer. People don\u2019t make that connection, especially if they are thinking, crikey I need to look after my urine flow or to get a PSA test. But if you look at it as a wider picture, there\u2019s lots of stuff you can do to improve your overall prostate health. So MOTs in the first place, get a health check every decade or even more frequently if you are able to. I think the NHS ones are very good in terms of the financial restrictions that we have. We can only screen you for the most common things, the diabetes, heart disease. We can\u2019t really screen you for prostate cancer. We can\u2019t look at the risk factors behind that. And I think after you\u2019ve done the screening, the other thing to look for, what are those elements of my life that I could improve, that would decrease my overall prostate disease risk. And if you think of prostate cancer, I mean, yes, it is incredibly common for men, but it\u2019s just another cancer. And if you think to yourself, what do I need to do to reduce my overall cancer risk? Well, there is very good evidence that for prostate cancer and others, if you\u2019re just more overweight, that\u2019s going to increase your prostate cancer risk. If you don\u2019t exercise enough, that increases your cancer risk. Interestingly, large amounts of calcium, which seems to be more an isolated risk to prostate cancer than most others, but we\u2019re talking pretty excessive amounts \u2013 necking pints of milk every day. Eating healthy diet is the most banal and what usually is unhelpful phrase, but you should eat a healthy diet, because you can make TV programmes out of it. But it really does work. And the sad thing is that it really decreases prostate cancer risk. If you can effectively keep your overall body healthy by not being overweight, by exercising and eating a healthy diet. Those are the best things you can do to remove prostate cancer risk.Well, good advice. Well, on that note, I think we\u2019re going to close out. I want to say thank you so much for speaking with me today. It\u2019s been a pleasure for me and I know our listeners will find this extremely helpful. So thanks for joining me.
