{"pageContent": "Recently, new generation androgen receptor (AK) targeted agents enzautamide or abiraterone etc.) has been clinically utilized in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, metastatic CRPC has also AR-independent survival pathway which leads to lethal phenotype by either adaptation or clonal selection resistant mechanism after AR targeted therapy. There are many studies regarding the progression mechanisms without AR signal transduction, such as growth factor, anti-apoptotic factor, and PTEN/mTOR pathway and so on. Also, cancer microenvironment and cancer stem cell is a hot research area for CRPC. It is very important to repress both AR-dependent and -independent signaling pathway to improve the clinical outcome in CRPC patients. Application of the new technology, such as next generation sequencing, would be developing for the prostate cancer research, providing pre-clinical proof-of-principle as a promising approach in CRPC.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer: Interpreting cost-utility analysis of prostate cancer treatment\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23399726/"}}
