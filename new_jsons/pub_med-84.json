{"pageContent": "The standard treatment options for organ-confined prostate cancer are radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy. A number of minimally invasive new technologies have also recently emerged. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is considered to be one of the most promising alternative therapies for prostate cancer. The indications for HIFU have recently been expanded to include its use both as a primary therapy for organ-confined prostate cancer as well as for local recurrence of prostate cancer, following radiation therapy. Although experience with the use of HIFU in the salvage setting following failed radiation therapy is limited, there is evidence to support the concept that HIFU offers comparable oncological outcomes to other established salvage treatment options for radiation-recurrent prostate cancer, with potentially less side effects. HIFU should be regarded as a viable alternative, especially for low-to-intermediate-risk cases of radiation-recurrent prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Focal Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Pending Questions\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27761805/"}}
