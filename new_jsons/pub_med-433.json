{"pageContent": "This work examines the use of lanthanide-based contrast agents and magnetic resonance imaging in monitoring liposomal behavior in vivo. Dysprosium (Dy) and gadolinium (Gd) chelates, Dy-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid bismethylamide (Dy-DTPA-BMA) and Gd-DTPA-BMA, were encapsulated in pegylated distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine-based (saturated) liposomes, and then intravenously injected into Copenhagen rats with subcutaneous Dunning AT2 xenografts. Liposome-encapsulated Dy chelate shortens transverse relaxation times (T(2) and T(2)*) of tissue; thus, liposomal accumulation in the tumor can be monitored by observing the decrease in T(2)* relaxation time over time. The tumor was treated at the time of maximum liposomal accumulation (48 h) with confocal, cavitating high-intensity focused ultrasound to induce liposomal payload release. Using liposome-encapsulated Gd chelate at high enough concentrations and saturated liposomal phospholipids induces an exchange-limited longitudinal (T(1)) relaxation when the liposomes are intact; when the liposomes are released, exchange limitation is relieved, thus allowing in vivo observation of payload release as a decrease in tumor T(1).", "metaData": {"source": "High intensity focused ultrasound as first line salvage therapy in prostate cancer local relapse after radical prostatectomy: 4-year follow-up outcomes\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28009150/"}}
