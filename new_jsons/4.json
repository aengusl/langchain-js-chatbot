Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer amongst men in the UK. And with this sombre fact comes a multitude of challenges and opportunities. I\u2019m Clare Delmar.

Mish, thank you so much for joining today. It\u2019s an absolute pleasure to have you.Thank you so much. It\u2019s great to be here. And I love what you said about how this is so often undiscussed. So thank you for reaching out to actually discuss the undiscussable.Yeah, we like that. We like that. So I think we\u2019re going to be off to something really interesting and insightful here. I mentioned in my intro about your blog, which is, of course, how I found you. So I want to just start off by commenting that in your blog you\u2019ve talked in some detail about support for the non clinical aspects of living with prostate cancer. And I\u2019m really interested in hearing more from you about this and what you\u2019ve learned from the many men you\u2019ve spoken with about not so much per se the treatment which we can get onto, but the so called non clinical aspects.Well, thanks. I mean, I think the deal is that there\u2019s a kind of an alliance between us that are diagnosed with cancer and the people who diagnose us, which is we all want to fix it. We just want the thing out of there. And then after that, some treatment has been done. If we\u2019re lucky, we don\u2019t have the cancer anymore. If we\u2019re not so lucky, we do. And there\u2019s a whole bunch of other stuff going on. What you just summarised as the non clinical aspects. And I think most men after their first treatment just feel lost and alone. I certainly did. And it\u2019s a little bit like you\u2019ve taken this great big journey to New York and you arrive at JFK and it\u2019s very exciting, but you would know and I\u2019ve experienced that, when you arrive at JFK, once you\u2019ve got your baggage, you\u2019re dumped out on the street. There\u2019s an arrival hall, but it\u2019s really just like a passageway. It\u2019s just like, get on with your life now.Yeah. I was just going to jump in and say, unless you\u2019re flying first class, but yes\u2026That\u2019s an experience I have yet to have.Absolutely. And most of us, too.But the point being that we don\u2019t have much of a roadmap. We are feeling lost and alone. We\u2019ve kind of had a rug pulled out of our sense of manhood, our sexual identity. We\u2019re kind of, like all over the place. And in my experience, the clinician who\u2019s done this amazing, magical treatment for me is not actually optimised for dealing with the stuff that I\u2019m dealing with. And he was frank with me when I asked him. He said, look, you already know more about this recovery aspects than I do. I\u2019m, in my case, a robotic surgeon. That\u2019s what I\u2019m good at and everything else. It\u2019s kind of like we\u2019re out on that curbside at JFK, but there\u2019s no cabs and there\u2019s no buses and there\u2019s no shuttles, and your friend hasn\u2019t come to pick you up. You\u2019re just staring at the blank tarmac.Yeah. Kind of like, where do we go from here? So in your discussions with all these men that you speak with, and I presume their partners, too, on occasion, do you think that there is an ideal model of support for so called non clinical aspects and for men going through prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment?I think there\u2019s so much that we can do. When we say ideal roadmap, it sounds like we can have a perfect fix. And really the start of the ideal roadmap for me is it\u2019s about adaptation rather than a perfect fix. There\u2019s a small proportion of us who do get a perfect fix, and lucky for them, but most of us, we are adapting to new bodies. And a lot of what I think the integrated care map needs to look like is a bunch of resources to help us adapt to our new bodies and to care for our bodies because we all know the cancer cells\u2026 there are going to be more mutations in our cells, even if you\u2019ve taken every single one out of our bodies in the treatment. And so we need to have healthy bodies to keep the cancer from really coming back in any significant way. You mentioned partners. I want to start there because that\u2019s kind of probably where the resources started for me was having a supportive partner. I think it\u2019s huge to have a supportive partner, and it takes an enormous amount for both partners to be able to talk about. It\u2019s often called the divorce disease or the couple\u2019s disease because it\u2019s so easy for either partner, male or female, but either the one with the cancer or the one without the cancer to just be freaked out and said, my partner is not what they used to be, I\u2019m out of here. Or for the owner or the ex owner of the prostate, the one who\u2019s been diagnosed to kind of go, Well, I\u2019m not the man I used to be, so I\u2019m out of here. That\u2019s the bigger context, I think, of the care plan. Then there\u2019s so much that is known. And all the men I talk to say that nobody spoke to them about their diet, their physical fitness and exercise, their mental health. It\u2019s rare to even be put in touch with a physiotherapist or physical therapist. And it\u2019s even more rare to have anybody kind of engaged with the kind of issues that are needed to develop a sexual inventiveness. Because sex is different when your body is different. And men particularly, we aren\u2019t trained for that. We have this very simple kind of sexual function. And suddenly that thing that used to kind of be in a certain way, it doesn\u2019t function that way anymore. And it\u2019s about being inventive and recreative and how do you make love rather than how do you just kind of poke around and it\u2019s all of that. There\u2019s tonnes known about that. It\u2019s a range of care and help and conversation and adaptation that\u2019s needed. But a simple roadmap would help.I mean, you mentioned about the changes in your sexual identity and your sexual function, to put it bluntly, it\u2019s a change in your sort of status. You\u2019re now dealing with something called vulnerability.Yeah, that\u2019s the bottom line.I think in my own conversations, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had them too, and maybe even experienced it. There are so many of these resources out there which you pointed out, it\u2019s how you kind of package them. Which actually leads me to another question. We agree that there are so many of these resources out there, but it\u2019s almost like a cruel irony that we live in this world that there\u2019s so much information out there, it\u2019s almost information overload to coin the term. And yet so many men feel unable to access and acquire the information they need to make the optimal choices about their care. And I\u2019m interested what you\u2019ve learned from your conversations about how men do seek the information and the support they need for some of the issues that you\u2019re describing.Thanks for raising that, because this is really one of my biggest, really ongoing research interests is what enables us to get the information, which, as you say, it\u2019s all there somewhere. What enables us to get it and what enables us to act on it?Exactly.Getting it, we can Google, but I\u2019m particularly well resourced, but it took me about a year to find the stuff, and now a lot of it is on my blog and it\u2019s all quite familiar. But what I\u2019ve noticed in working with other men is a lot of people acquire information more through conversation and stories than through sort of download. And so that\u2019s why I created my blog the way I did. I\u2019m telling my own story in excerpts, a bit like Charles Dickens, another episode every week or two, like a TV series, and I\u2019m getting other people to do the same. And also in the support group, we just talk and we have a topic, but it\u2019s very loose. And what I\u2019m noticing is that men and their partners kind of pick up on stuff when they\u2019re ready. And that\u2019s so contrary to the more clinical sort of model of like, now the treatment, there\u2019s a date, there\u2019s a hospital visit. I don\u2019t want to put all the blame if I\u2019m suggesting that on the clinical establishment, because what I see is we\u2019re like hand in glove. The clinical establishment is, and to its credit, very thorough about that clinical model. And we, as the consumers of that service, actually love it. We just want a fix. So many men say to me, I just want that cancer out of me. I don\u2019t really care about anything else. Don\u2019t tell me about urinary control and sexual function. Just get the cancer out.Yeah.So we come in with this deep desire for a complete solution, and often our clinical practitioners come with the equivalent desire to give us a perfect solution. And then a lot of stuff gets lost in the rush into like, this is the quick fix. There\u2019s a lot of depth that\u2019s needed. There\u2019s a lot of examining, understanding, adapting, as I keep saying, and I think the diagnosee and the diagnosor are both not naturally tuned to doing. We\u2019re both naturally tuned to just let\u2019s get the quick fix and get out of here.Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s interesting because I can understand that mentality. But I wonder if you\u2019ve noticed how much it varies across different types of men, for lack of a better term. And one of the things I\u2019m particularly interested in is do you find variations in the age of men when they first get their diagnosis?Not being a clinician, I can\u2019t give you data on that. But my gut feel is that we\u2019re getting diagnosed younger and we\u2019re living longer. So I felt like I was on the cusp of this. I was diagnosed at 61, and there was a little bit of that voice that sort of like you\u2019re an old guy. Sex is like for young men, just get rid of the cancer. And my urologist did sort of say, I think you\u2019re too young for that approach. But I could feel he was on the edge of saying it\u2019s a sort of minimal care because you\u2019re old now. I think the two things that are happening now are that we\u2019re living longer. So even if we are only diagnosed at 70, we still got the chance of living for another 20, 30 years or more. And secondly, that we are getting diagnosed earlier, thank goodness. So I think that the demands for quality of life can only increase from here. So I\u2019m still relatively polite about it. But what I hear from the men I talk to is just extreme anger. Whether it\u2019s all true or not, their belief is, the doctor lied to me and said I would be fixed, and now I\u2019m not and I\u2019m angry. And he\u2019s taken away my joy of sex or he\u2019s taken away my just joy of simply walking without a nappy.\u00a0That\u2019s the language I hear out there. It\u2019s anger about what clinically they call quality of life issues, which is really all aspects of health, other than the very specific thing that the treatment addressed. To me that\u2019s all aspects of treatment. It\u2019s all clinical. It\u2019s like how\u2019s my head, how\u2019s my heart, how\u2019s my sexual function? Those all clinical things, actually. It\u2019s just that they\u2019re not always treated by surgery. Some of them are treated by physiotherapy or psychotherapy..Counselling\u2026Or visiting my conversation group.So then I was going to just pick up on that because I hear similar things. People who come to our clinic often are also angry for various reasons, and some of them correlate with what you\u2019re saying. And I just want to test you on an idea. Do you think that some of these men feel that they\u2019re stereotyped? Do you think that they feel like, well, I was considered too old, which is you\u2019ve touched on that already, or I\u2019m a gay man, for example, or I don\u2019t have a partner or some way that they might be categorised, that they feel that they\u2019ve almost been stereotyped. And I just wonder about that because you\u2019ve met a lot of men who have undergone this treatment and this experience. So I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s something you\u2019ve seen. And do you think it\u2019s been seen to impede any kind of progress in their care?Yes, and thank you for mentioning it. When you mention this, the biggest one is black men who are much more at much higher risk of prostate cancer than anyone else than any other men and yet get less treatment. And that\u2019s a much bigger systemic issue. Right. That\u2019s about systemic racism. It\u2019s not just about the clinical establishment. And I think gay men often feel like and I noticed so much of the research is heteronormative, so much of what\u2019s written and the International Index of Erectile Function, which was really popularised by Pfizer and Viagra marketing people. It\u2019s all about having conventional heterosexual sex with your female partner. And it\u2019s off. It\u2019s time. It\u2019s long past its sell by date. And it\u2019s highly off putting to anybody who is sexual and makes love in ways that are different to the heteronormal kind of stereotype and that\u2019s people of all genders and sexualities and races and so on. So, yes, there\u2019s a tonne there. And underlying those specific categories is also just a sort of a broader category that I think is lurking behind all of these is kind of the stereotype of the broken man.What do you mean by that?Well, yeah. I don\u2019t know how much this comes from the practitioners and how much comes from the diagnosees. But I noticed a lot of us feel like, well, until now, my life was about possibility and my male identity is sort of I\u2019m driving, I\u2019m energetic, I\u2019m an initiator. And now in a way that\u2019s very dear to my heart and my groin, I can\u2019t do that anymore. And I just feel broken. And I feel like I\u2019m no longer\u2026 I think a lot of men feel like they no longer are men. I feel like I\u2019m just a different man. And my manhood is way more than my erection and my sexuality is way more than that as well. And my libido is way more than sexuality. But I do think that there is a sort of underlying stereotype of what it is to be a man that is not serving us. I have a friend in the UK, a gay man in the UK. He keeps saying being a man often gets in the way of being a man with prostate cancer. That male stereotypes kind of block us.Right.And I think he\u2019s very wise and I think he\u2019s accurate. And I think that\u2019s some of our work. So when I said I\u2019d love to have integrated care, what I don\u2019t believe is it\u2019s all about someone giving us stuff. I think there\u2019s a lot of us about us being empowered and empowering ourselves to kind of claim the way forward. And that then is infinitely varied. We\u2019ve mentioned some of the variations of race, of sexual preference, of age, etc. But actually, each person creating our own roadmap is unique. And that\u2019s my other big interest is how do we empower ourselves? How do we help other men and their partners be empowered to find their way through this, to actually create the roadmap? It\u2019s not just about information and it\u2019s not just about treatment. It\u2019s also about adaptation. And it\u2019s a lot about dashboards. How do we get enough information and feedback about our health so that we\u2019re getting feedback that we can take action on?YeahNot just saying I must go to a professional and have them diagnose me.Right. Or have it categorised in a term like personalised care or something that. Yeah, it is a little bit more holistic, isn\u2019t it? But I would say that it\u2019s precisely by having conversations with people like yourself and getting these stories out there that is the beginning of all of this. And you\u2019ve done a wonderful thing with your blog, and I congratulate you on that and wish you all the best in taking it forward. And also want to thank you very much for joining me today. I\u2019m sure our listeners will have found it very stimulating, very insightful, and hopefully we\u2019ll do it again.Thank you so much. I\u2019ll just give credit to Chimamanda Adichie, who says, beware of the single story. We need many stories. And that\u2019s what my blog is doing. And if you\u2019re listening to this and you\u2019ve got a story. Get in touch.I\u2019ll make sure that people do. Thanks. Once again. It\u2019s been a pleasure.
