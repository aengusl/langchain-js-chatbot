{"pageContent": "The 3-D transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy system is a novel device that allows precise needle placement in a template fashion. We evaluate its utility for prostate cancer (PCa) detection. A retrospective analysis was performed evaluating 68 prospective patients at the Duke Prostate Center who underwent a prostate biopsy using a 3-D TRUS-guided system. After creation of a three-dimensional map of the prostate, a computer algorithm identified an ideal biopsy scheme based on the measured dimensions of the prostate. The system then used a fixed template that allowed prostate biopsy at specific locations with the ability to target the same region of the prostate in the future if needed. For all patients, a 12-core biopsy pattern was used to cover medial and lateral areas of the base, mid-gland, and apex. In total, 68 patients underwent 3-D TRUS-guided prostate biopsies between April 2006 and November 2007 for prostate cancer detection. The indication for prostate biopsy was PSA > or = 4.0 ng/ml in 47 (69%) patients, abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) in 17 (25%), and atypia on previous biopsy in 4 (6%) patients. Prostate cancer was detected in 18 patients (26.5%) and 7 (10.3%) had atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP). The highest frequency (55.5%) from all cases of cancer detected was identified when 3-D TRUS biopsy was used as the initial biopsy. This study demonstrates that a 3-D TRUS-guided biopsy system translates to a more frequent detection of prostate cancer among patients undergoing an initial prostate biopsy than a subsequent one. More comprehensive studies are warranted to corroborate and extend the results of this study.", "metaData": {"source": "High-intensity focused ultrasound for prostate cancer: tempering our enthusiasm\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23827736/"}}
