{"pageContent": "A shift in the use of prostate MR for diagnosis, staging, and pre-treatment planning over the last several years has modified the MR protocols. Classically used to detect extra-prostatic tumor, MR now plays a role for diagnosis (pre-biopsy evaluation in a patient with elevated PSA and suspected cancer in an unusual site), treatment planning (prostate mapping), and follow-up after treatment (evaluation for local recurrence or follow-up after HIFU, radiation therapy, or focal treatment...). Imaging protocols at 1.5T and 3.0T combine morphological T2W imaging with functional sequences (perfusion imaging, diffusion imaging, spectroscopy) using high-resolution phased array pelvic coils or \"combined\" coils (added endorectal coil). To promote acceptance by clinicians and increased access to patients, the indications for prostate MR must be better defined (and provide useful data to urologists), the cost must be reduced, and results must be more reproducible and standardized.", "metaData": {"source": "Five years experience of transrectal high-intensity focused ultrasound using the Sonablate device in the treatment of localized prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16643614/"}}
