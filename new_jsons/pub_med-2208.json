{"pageContent": "Background: Prostate cancer is presently diagnosed by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided sextant needle biopsy. While echo texture of the tissue can prompt localization of tumor, it is presently imprecise. From 50-75% of men biopsied, based on an abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) or elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, have negative biopsy results. Improvements in tumor localization during TRUS-guided prostate biopsy are greatly needed. Bioimpedance is an electrical property of biologic tissue. Electric current is limited in living tissue by highly insulating cell membranes; however, different tissue architecture such as cancer may impede current differently and allow detection of differences between normal and abnormal or malignant prostate tissue. Our goal was to assess the utility of bioimpedance measurements in differentiating tumor from normal prostatic tissue in an ex vivo model.", "metaData": {"source": "Individual- and neighborhood-level education influences the effect of obesity on prostate cancer treatment failure after prostatectomy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26169299/"}}
