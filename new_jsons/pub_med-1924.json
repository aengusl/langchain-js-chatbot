{"pageContent": "Urological problems especially connected with prostate diseases appear in older men: prostatitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate cancer and others. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and the second leading cause of deaths in male population. Therefore, it seems important to early detect prostate cancer in general practice setting due to screening procedures such as digital rectal exam and prostate-specific-antigen test. The aim of the study was to examine the character of diagnoses of a prostate disease among 1,004 men of the Lublin district who reported to a doctor during screening procedure carried out in urology outpatient clinic at Clinical Hospital in Lublin in the year 2000. After physical examination urologists initially diagnosed a prostate disease and sent men suspected to have a prostate cancer to further investigations. There was studied age and place of living. Benign prostate hyperplasia was the most common diagnosis made in 77.1% of subjects. It occurred most often in men aged 51-70 years. Prostate cancer was suspected in 3.5% of subjects. Frequency of benign prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer suspicion increased with age. On the basis of studies screening procedures seem beneficial in the early detection of prostate cancer in men over 50.", "metaData": {"source": "Not all prostate cancer is the same - patient perceptions: an Asia-Pacific region study\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32521568/"}}
