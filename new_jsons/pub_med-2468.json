{"pageContent": "Three variants of gamma-beam therapy of prostatic cancer were worked out on the basis of a thorough topometric preparation, an analysis of dose distributions using computer, and taking account of tumor dissemination. It has been shown that moving one- or two-field gamma-beam therapy is indicated in cases when tumor lies within the limits of the prostate only. When it affects regional lymph nodes the combination of moving gamma-beam therapy with static 4-field cross irradiation with the ratio of doses from the front and back fields 2:1 is recommended. When tumor involves the nearest lymphatic collectors gamma-beam therapy is supplemented by estrogens with stage-by-stage irradiation of primary tumor, regional lymph nodes (by the above schemes) and the paraaortal group of lymph nodes from 2 opposite shaped fields, a focal dose to these nodes being 30-40 Gy only. The summary focal dose to the regional lymph nodes is 45-50 Gy, to primary tumor 65-70 Gy. The above variants of gamma-beam therapy were used for the treatment of 69 patients with prostatic cancer, Stages II-IV. Not a single patient developed marked reactions and late complications 6-36 mos. after therapy, 61% of the patients lived over 3 yrs.", "metaData": {"source": "Attomolar detection of extracellular microRNAs released from living prostate cancer cells by a plasmonic nanowire interstice sensor\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29095457/"}}
