Alternative treatment options include thermal ablation strategies such as high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).", "metaData": {"source": "Optimization of ultrasound array designs for high intensity focused treatment of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19326161/"}}
