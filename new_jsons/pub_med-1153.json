{"pageContent": "DHEA is a prohormone that is secreted by the corticoadrenal glands on a nyctohemeral rhythm alike to that of testosterone. Its plasmatic level gets reduced with ageing in a great amount of individuals, but not in all. Moreover, DHEA is a neurosteroid synthesized by certain neurons. As shown by correlation studies, lowered levels of DHEA wre linked to a higher death rate, in part of the studied population. Besides, an improvement in well being as well as in some mental functions, after a 50 mg daily intake, was shown in preliminary studies. Many well-conducted studies followed which only partially confirmed the previous ones. Nowadays, it seems to be taken for granted that DHEA becomes estrogens and androgens and that its action on women is mainly an androgenic one. DHEA becomes active after intracellular transformation, which varies according to the enzymatic set of cells. Some effect on elderly women's libido, and improvement in erectile dysfunction in men without vascular pathology but a lowered DHEA level, has been observed. Thus, using DHEA in order to cure sexual troubles might be considered, although the possible negative effects of DHEA, especially on breast and prostate, have not been discarded yet. The conditions under which it could have a beneficial effect on mental functions remains to be discovered. Acknowledgement of those pathological situations, in which DHEA could prove useful, as well as the administration posology is, therefore, crucial.", "metaData": {"source": "Optimizing outcomes and quality of life in the hormonal treatment of prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16566812/"}}
