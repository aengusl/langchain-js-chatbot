Prostate cancer is now the most commonly diagnosed cancer amongst men in the UK. With this sombre fact becomes a multitude of challenges and opportunities. I\u2019m Clare Delmar. Joining me today is Ian Paul, a recent patient at The Focal Therapy Clinic who came to the clinic seeking a second opinion following what turned out to be an incorrect diagnosis. Ian is 58, a divorced father of two with a partner of five years. He works as a project manager in the energy sector, and he\u2019s played guitar in a band for over 18 years as well. Ian, welcome and thank you so much for joining OnFocus today.Hi, Clare. Nice to be talking to you today.Wonderful. OK, well, let\u2019s jump right in because you\u2019ve got quite a story that I know many of our listeners will very much appreciate and value hearing about. And let\u2019s just start with one of the things that really struck me when we first met, which was, you know, your experience began in what I might call almost an ideal setting. I mean, you were privately insured. You were routinely undertaking PSA tests through regular check-ups. So can you describe what happened when your PSA became elevated?Yeah, sure. I mean, basically, I\u2019d spent three years just going through regular tests. And this is all, you know, as you said, through my sort of work based insurance health checks and my PSA was around about three and a half to four and it was relatively stable, but it was probably what could be considered to be slightly raised. But then the people I was talking to at the time, the consultant said it\u2019s pretty normal for someone of my age to have a raised PSA. And it wasn\u2019t until, I suppose about Feb/March time last year I had the regular six monthly test and it was fine, it was a four and then six months later, it suddenly jumped to seven. Now I\u2019m a keen cyclist. I\u2019d heard about cycling on road bikes and stuff like that, especially how a hard saddle can aggravate the prostate and it can increase the PSA within the blood. So I booked another test about two weeks later and it went up to seven and a half. So this really was ringing alarm bells in my mind anyway. I made an appointment to go see the urologist who I\u2019d seen and I\u2019ve been seeing, you know, I suppose I\u2019d seen a couple of times over that three year period. I went to see him and he suggested that because it\u2019s such a sharp rise over such a short period of time that I have an mpMRI scan, which was the next course of action, I suppose. I had that in December. And then in January, when I got the results, I was told that there was an abnormality showing up on the scan. And as a result of that, he said, look, I think we need to do the biopsy. We need to find out what\u2019s going on. So I had the biopsy in early January, basically.OK, and were you briefed on the biopsy method that you underwent?I was told that it was going to be relatively straightforward. It would be under a local anaesthetic. I was told not to concern myself about it because it was going to be nothing more than going to the dentist. You know, just, you know, having an injection at the dentist. Although I have to say that nothing could be further from the truth, to be honest with you.How so?The local anaesthetic injections in that particular area of your body is really, really unpleasant. And then the actual needles going in to actually take the samples, even with the anaesthetic, was excruciatingly painful. And I\u2019m surprised, actually, that the biopsies are actually done in that way and that particular method. The consultant took 10 samples altogether, but it took 25 minutes. And the one thing that I was very conscious of was the fact that, you know, I\u2019m not sitting quietly and still because it was so painful. I knew I was shifting, you know, my position and I\u2019m thinking to myself at the time that there couldn\u2019t be an awful lot of accuracy if I\u2019m shifting around, you know, because of the squirming in my seat basically, because it was so painful.Yeah.But I wasn\u2019t expecting it and I certainly wasn\u2019t warned for that level of pain.That does sound very unpleasant. And what happened next? When did you get the results of that biopsy and then what happened?Yeah, well, I suppose I waited for about a week and a half to get the results. And consultant told me that of the ten samples that he took, one of them contained five percent cancer cells. And so, in effect, what he told me is it was low grade cancer, nothing really to worry about. All we need to do really is go through some active surveillance. And, you know, what\u2019s active surveillance? He said, well, you know, we\u2019ll just go through regular six monthly PSA tests and we\u2019ll just monitor it that way. I said, okay, so what are the other options? You know, I mean, he said, well, the other option potentially, he said I could have a prostatectomy, which basically would be the removal of the prostate. You know, that way there\u2019s a guarantee that, you know, you\u2019re not going to get prostate cancer again and it\u2019s going to be something that would, you know, remove the situation. Now, I said, well, I\u2019ve obviously done my own research, and that to me isn\u2019t an option because, you know, I\u2019m only 58 years old. I\u2019m still sexually active and want to remain so. You know, I think that\u2019s, all the things that I\u2019d heard about prostate removed would suggest erectile dysfunction and incontinence. And I said, I\u2019m not prepared to go through that. So, you know, I said to myself, what other options are there? You know, he said, well, you know, there\u2019s brachytherapy, but then there\u2019s hormone treatment, but that\u2019s not\u2026 I don\u2019t recommend that. And he said, I think, you know, given the grade of cancer, I said, I think you should be looking at the active surveillance route. So I said, okay, let me let me have a think about that, because I\u2019m not 100% convinced. I left his office and I was driving home, and the more I thought about it, the more kind of, not angry, but the more concerned I felt because the more I thought about it, the more I thought, well, this is a sentence hanging over my head over the next few months, next couple of years or whatever, my PSA could raise, you know, or double in the space of six months, which it had done. Who\u2019s to say that within the next six months after my PSA test, you know, during active surveillance, that, you know, that cancer wouldn\u2019t spread outside of the prostate and impact other parts of the body, then I\u2019d be dealing with a situation where I\u2019d probably have to have the prostate removed and I\u2019d be dealing with secondary cancer. This is not an option I said, in my mind. I said this is not an option. So the first thing I did when I got home was go on the Internet. And I think within five minutes I found The Focal Therapy Clinic. And just reading through, you know, every single page, every single interview, every single bit of information was there. It made me suddenly realise that, you know, that there\u2019s so many more options out there and not every treatment and not every solution is suitable for everybody.Yeah. Let me let me just ask really quickly, just before we go on to the second opinion that you eventually sought. I mean, why do you think active surveillance was recommended to you? And did you also feel when you said that you didn\u2019t think it was appropriate for you? Was the covid situation a concern to you, given that you\u2019d have to be continuously monitored?Yeah, I mean, even though I suppose I\u2019m one of the lucky ones. I mean, I didn\u2019t have to wait long for an MRI scan. I didn\u2019t have to wait long for various appointments. I still had to wait a few weeks. And I think that waiting it played on my mind and it did have an impact on me.OK, yeah. So then you decided to seek a second opinion. So tell us about that. And it seemed to have involved some very different approaches to both the diagnostics and the treatment options. Can you tell us exactly what happened then?Having found The Focal Therapy Clinic online, the first thing I did was basically go on and complete their online questionnaire, which basically asked for a whole bunch of details about me, the diagnosis I had received and any details associated with that diagnosis, plus sort of providing some notes as to why I was contacting them specifically. And then literally the following day, I received a response from Suki Cooper, who is one of the patient advocates. And what I found was that she was incredibly good at just explaining things to me. Just having someone tell me about the different options that could be available to me, it was really eye opening. It was a real breath of fresh air. So, you know, one of the things I talked to her about was the fact that having read pretty much everything I could about the high intensity focal ultrasound therapy, that would be an ideal treatment for me if I was a suitable candidate, because it could potentially be what I would call the silver bullet, the thing that would actually get rid of cancer without any long term treatment plan after that. She basically put me in touch with one of the consultants\u2019 secretaries, after I looked over the locations where the various consultants were located, and I decided on Marc Laniado because he was very much local to where I live. And his practice is within about 10 miles of where I live. So he was the ideal candidate really for me. So she passed me to Marc\u2019s secretary and I got an appointment within a few days.OK, and then you know what happened with actually your diagnostic results even before we get to assessing your suitability for focal therapy?Marc Laniado in the first meeting, said that his sort of view on the MRI scan and also on the pathology results weren\u2019t clear. He couldn\u2019t, because the actual MRI scan was not 100 percent sharp. And he said it\u2019s going to be difficult for him to provide a very precise diagnosis because of that. And so he said, look, you know, the one thing that we really need to do is make sure that we get the diagnosis 100 percent accurate. And the only way we can do that is by performing a second biopsy. And, of course, this worried me, you know, it worried me because of what I went through for the first time. And I told him my concerns about, you know, having that done under local anaesthetic. And he was surprised when I said it was done. You know, I was thinking it was going to be done under local anaesthetic. He said, no, no, I\u2019ll be doing this under general anaesthetic. And I think just judging by his reaction, I think he was surprised that I thought it was going to be done under a local anaesthetic, which then got me thinking about well should I have had the original one done under local?Yeah.But I don\u2019t know. I mean, I\u2019ve got no experience of that and I haven\u2019t read any information about.Yeah. Yeah. So you basically had to have a new biopsy and it was done with a different approach?Absolutely. So I went into the hospital as a day case and underwent a general anaesthetic and had the second biopsy. And during that time I had 40 samples taken.Yeah, that\u2019s incredible. I mean, just to repeat that. So initially you had 10 and this time you had 40.Yeah, yeah. Well, 10 was taken around the whole prostate.Yeah, indeed.40 were taken very specifically around that particular area where the tumour was. So. Yeah. So a very, very in-depth biopsy. And of course when I got the results of that, Mr Laniado basically said, you know, it\u2019s actually probably worse than perhaps you thought it was going to be and certainly worse than your original consultant said, in that the Gleason score came back as a three plus four, as opposed to a three plus three. But what he did tell me was that the tumour was very much sort of centred in one specific location, and it wasn\u2019t something that was spread around the prostate. So, you know, in his opinion, I would be a candidate for the HIFU therapy, but he had to basically take that through to the multidisciplinary committee that he chaired, where cases like mine get discussed and they go through all of the results and they go through the pathology and the MRI scans, et cetera, and basically come up with a kind of, if you like, a like a committee decision based on the evidence that\u2019s being presented. And fortunately for me, it meant that I was going to be a suitable candidate for this therapy.The MDT is a very powerful approach because you\u2026 I\u2019m sure it gave you a lot of confidence to know that the treatment was actually something that was going to be appropriate and was thought to be something that would be curative?Having had that conversation and knowing that there are other people that were actually assessing my case.Indeed.Inspired me with exactly the kind of confidence that I needed to know that I was in the right hands.So there are so many things that come out of that. I mean, clearly. Initially, you hadn\u2019t even really been briefed about the different elements of the diagnosis, whether it was the PSA test, which you clearly knew about, but then the imaging, the role of the quality of the imaging, the type of biopsy, the quality of the biopsy, the pathology, I mean, you clearly learnt a lot in this whole process.Absolutely, yeah.So given that and the fact that you had a good outcome, because just to conclude your story, you then did undergo HIFU treatment with Marc, and that was when Ian?That was in early March.Right. And things have gone well since?I had a further MRI scan week after. And the results came back as a positive in that there was no evidence of any further cancer cells. And basically, it was a good MRI.And you\u2019re feeling well, generally?Took me about two or three weeks to get to a position where I actually felt comfortable again.Yeah.But, and it does take a while before, you know, some of the side effects start to wear away and disappear. But right now, you know, I\u2019m in the middle of May and I\u2019m feeling absolutely brilliant.I mean, that\u2019s really good news. And, you know, I know you\u2019re delighted with that. But I think equally, we spoke about the fact that it made you wonder about what happened before you sought the second opinion. And I want to talk a little bit about the outcome of your attempts to challenge the original consultant urologist who initially diagnosed you. Just ask you what you can draw from this that might help other men in a similar situation.Yeah, I mean, one of the things I found was that, you know, we all tend to look at consultants as the font of all knowledge. You know, they\u2019re the people that we go to because they know what\u2019s good for us and what\u2019s right for us. At least that\u2019s the impression that we will always have because of the position they hold within the medical profession. But when I was presented with my first diagnosis with the original consultant and the fact that he said active surveillance is the thing, you know, I\u2019m recommending, you know, I went back to him and I did email him and say, look, I\u2019m not convinced about this, because in the letter that you sent to my doctor, you said that you\u2019ve taken me through all of the suitable treatments and that I\u2019m recommending active surveillance. And I said, but the point is, you didn\u2019t take me through all of the options because there are so many out there. And the more research I did, the more I realised that there were lots of different options. You know, some might be suitable, some might not be, but to have the information presented to me, would at least made me feel like I was, you know, kind of getting the right level of data so that I can make a decision about what\u2019s right for me.Indeed. And informed. We call that informed consent.Absolutely, you know, and as a result of that, I mean, I said, look, I\u2019m keen to find out more about this thing called HIFU therapy because, you know, to me, that sounds like a really good treatment. I know it\u2019s under trial within the NHS, and I know that it\u2019s available through private medicine as well, because my insurance company have said that they would support it financially. So they would support it and the fact that it\u2019s under trial and has been for about eight to 10 years says to me that it\u2019s you know, it\u2019s a good option. It\u2019s a viable option. And now the consultant who I spoke to came back to me and said I wouldn\u2019t recommend HIFU therapy to my relatives, let alone to you. And I said, well, why not? And he said, because there isn\u2019t enough data to support it. And I said, well, how on earth are these treatments ever going to make it into mainstream unless there\u2019s data to support it? And that requires people to be part of trials \u2026.Exactly.You have to make those kind of informed decisions. If I had been in a situation where I was being told you could have this thing called HIFU therapy, but it\u2019s only available on the NHS and it\u2019s only available as a trial, I would have looked at the numbers. I would have looked at the success rate, and I would have still made the same decision to say it\u2019s got to be better than sitting around doing nothing and waiting for something worse to happen. I would have been one of those people on that trial saying, yes, I want this. We\u2019re being presented by information by some consultants that doesn\u2019t always provide the full picture, to me is not right. And I think that the the consultant in question is very much stuck in his ways. And perhaps he\u2019s not prepared to embrace new technology and new treatments or even to recommend new treatments because he\u2019s not necessarily up with what\u2019s going on. I think the important thing for me was that I made the decision to go for a second opinion because the moment I did when I was in control of it.Yeah, and that\u2019s what you would recommend to other men? To question everything?Question everything, and if you\u2019re not happy with what you\u2019re hearing, say, look, you know, I appreciate your opinion, but I\u2019d like to get a second opinion.Yeah.I\u2019d like to know there\u2019s more out there. But also I\u2019d recommend to anybody in my situation to just have a look on Internet, because you\u2019ve only got to do a single search and you\u2019ll find so many different organisations. And The Focal Therapy Clinic is the one that comes up number one on the search. And there are other organisations out there as well where you can get your advice.I mean, you were lucky because you were also privately insured and you obviously had the initiative and the knowledge to do this, but I think the more we hear stories like yours that even the best care can have flaws and it\u2019s important for you to self advocate and question everything.Well, look, I mean, let me give an example, Clare. I mean, yesterday I got a call from a colleague of mine and his neighbour has just told him two days ago, he\u2019s had a diagnosis of prostate cancer and he wants to know who I went to see, what the name of the clinic was, what the treatment was. And so I basically sent this guy links to The Focal Therapy Clinic, to a number of different other websites that talk about the different options that you could have available to you. So just being able to share the experience is brilliant.Yeah, well, I mean, it\u2019s incredibly generous of you to do that. And I\u2019m delighted that you\u2019ve had such a good outcome and that you\u2019ve been so generous in sharing your time and your personal experience with us. So thank you very much for coming today. And we look forward to talking to you again.Thank you very much, pleasure.For further information on standards of diagnostic procedures and how these underpin optimal treatments is available on our website, along with the transcript of this interview and additional interviews and stories about men living with prostate cancer.
