{"pageContent": "Local recurrence after external radiotherapy or brachytherapy occurs in 30% of patients treated for prostate cancer. These recurrences can be localised to the prostate and controlled by salvage treatment. Salvage prostatectomy is the gold standard treatment, however, it is associated with a high morbidity rate. Minimally invasive treatments such as cryotherapy and high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) can be proposed to treat local recurrences. Indications, complications and oncological results of these salvage treatments are discussed in this article.", "metaData": {"source": "The role of high-intensity focused ultrasound in prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17430694/"}}
