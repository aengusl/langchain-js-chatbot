{"pageContent": "Sexual histories were obtained from 51 patients (average age 67.7 years) with prostatic cancer and their spouses before and after pelvic lymphadenectomy and retropubic 125iodine implantation. Sexual potency was retained in 40 of the 41 patients who were sexually active preoperatively. Ten patients were sexually inactive preoperatively: 4 with diminished potency and 6 with complete erectile impotence. Sexual dysfunction was most often psychogenic in origin. At 6 months 5 of these patients had resumed satisfactory sexual intercourse as a result of reassurance, encouragement and education of remaining sexual potential. No patient suffered complete erectile impotence as a result of the procedure.", "metaData": {"source": "Long-term quality of life outcome after proton beam monotherapy for localized prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21621343/"}}
