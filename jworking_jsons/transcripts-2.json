{"pageContent": " foreign today we're talking about Gleason 8 specifically four plus four so a lot of people get this on the pathology report and they want to know what does it mean especially in newly diagnosed cases so what is your explanation of gleasonate prostate cancer well the what they're talking about is the way the cells look under the microscope and these experts Pathologists who only look at microscopes all day long can predict based on the appearance of the cells whether this type of cancer is more or less likely to spread outside through\n the bloodstream into the lymph nodes or to the bones and that of course is the defining issue in deciding how aggressive treatment is required they can scale treatment up or scale treatment down in the prostate cancer world and they use information like the Gleason score to determine if you want to be more aggressive do you want to add hormone treatments do you want to add treatment to the pelvic lymph nodes and the possibility there's cancer out there so this is one of the most important factors in determining how risky this\n individual's cancer is and How likely is that it could spread outside the gland so how does one go about confirming that it's absolutely gleasonate four plus four doctors that are looking through the microscope we call them Pathologists they do come in different skill levels some have more experience with prostate cancer others less and if there is uncertainty about the quality of the Pathology Department you can get a second opinion at different reference centers such as Johns Hopkins has been a favorite of ours they do a lot of\n prostate work there and those are a way for confirmation 10 15 years ago we had a lot more problem with people misreading Gleason scores it's it's become a little more mainstream and so I don't routinely have everyone with gleasonate re-read it's not a really difficult diagnosis but if there were any reason to question it's easy to double check so before we move further I want to clarify something I think a lot of people see that they're in a gleasonate category and they it's more serious and they get very concerned\n about survival rates so can you talk about survival rates with Gleason a prostate cancer and it's not just that it's gleasonate I think the word cancer itself people are so familiar it's cancerous you know right up there with heart disease is one of the most common causes of death and what people don't seem to be able to grasp readily is how different prostate is from say lung cancer colon cancer liver cancer pancreas cancer where people could be dead within months from those horrible diseases and they're not\n uncommon so most people have had a brush with that and a family member or friend and the word cancer is truly terrifying prostate is I don't really have an easy description for because when people die of prostate cancer it's usually after they've had it for 10 to 20 years that's a different issue and then of course there's this assumption that everyone that gets it is at risk for dying and that's not true over 200 000 people are diagnosed every year in the United States the mortality\n rates in the United States are about 20 000 people a year so maybe 10 percent of people that have prostate cancer could go on and die but that won't be for another 10 15 20 or 25 years with existing technology now there's so much new stuff out maybe those people that were projected that I won't even die because of new discoveries so the death rates are low cure rates are incredibly High even if it is a Gleason 8 and if people are screened and caught at an early stage almost all of them will be cured so what are factors that\n would determine treatment for glycinate well we have to look at a number of factors because you have people with a small amount of gleasonate say a young person with a small amount of gleasonate you could have an older person with a small amount of glycinate then if what if someone has a gleasonate but they have a large tumor or seminal vesicle Invasion or lymph node involvement or even spread to the bones these are all different angles on what we call Gleason Aid and the amount of glycinate determined by scans determined by how\n high the PSA is determined by if they had a random biopsy how many cores have cancer in them uh so I would say the next issue if someone has a gleasonate how what age group are they in how much cancer is present after you're done with all the scanning uh we believe as of 2022 everyone should be getting a psma pet scan to determine extent of disease it's a fabulous new technology but we need to have a sense of what kind of a gleasonate is it we're in a world where psma pet scans are new and the common\n way most practiced for years has been determining the risk of spread has been based off of the Gleason score so if that's the case and now psma pet scan how is psma changed how you would determine risk of spread well it's a free-for-all right now because we don't have long-term clinical trials you know giving psma pet scans and seeing based on those results what the 10-year outcomes are going to be we have to project on what we think is going on if we go back to the fact that Gleason score was to help you determine if there\n was any cancer spread and if a psma pet scan which is a very accurate scan says they there's no cancer spread then should a Gleason 8 which previously told us there's a high risk of cancer spread still pushes towards aggressive multimodality therapy the standard treatment in the past was to give radiation to the prostate and the lymph nodes in 18 months of testosterone deprivation pretty heavy-handed stuff but thought to be necessary to ensure optimal cure rates so now if a pet scan shows no spread can we lighten up and treat these\n people more like an intermediate risk we know that a negative psma pet scan in other words a scan showing no spread in a gleasonate is going to be accurate about four out of five times so the chance of relapse if you treat the prostate alone is only going to be about 20 percent 20 sounds high but if you add 18 months of hormone therapy and radiate the pelvic lymph nodes you're only going to improve the Cure rates about 50 percent which means you'll go from a 80 percent cure rate to a 90 cure rate you\n have to treat nine people to benefit one person with 18 months of hormone therapy and pelvic lymph node radiation these sorts of numbers need to be run by the patients and they can decide because we also know that psma pet scans are going to catch recurrent disease at a much earlier stage than we've ever been able to do before we we're going to be able to cure some of those people that have recurrences and they find a little lymph node in the pelvis treated aggressively at that juncture maybe half of those people will be curable so\n there's your 50 reduction Improvement in cure rates right there but then you don't have to treat everybody with 18 months of hormone therapy to get that so I know I've moved through quickly with a lot of numbers but the bottom line issue here is that we have to start modifying our thinking about Gleason 8 when we have a pet scan showing no spread if we have a pest scan that shows metastatic disease in the lymph nodes for example then it's pedal to the metal we know that this individual has a type of\n cancer that has a genetic capacity to spread this is dangerous potentially life-threatening they certainly need 18 months of hormone therapy they need radiation to the pelvic lymph nodes and some of these people maybe should get a short course of chemotherapy to that will improve their cure rates 10 to 15 percent improving curates 10 to 15 and someone with a known cancer that can metastasize is valuable improving curates 10 percent in people that don't we're not even sure their cancer can metastasize would be\n justifiable if the treatments were very innocuous but they're not the 18 months of hormone therapy is a life-changing experience for people and people are well aware of that now so we're trying to balance out the the toxicity of the treatment with the how much real value are you getting out of these aggressive therapies I think one thing I really appreciate about the psma Pet Scan is not only are we seeing the cancer but it has the capacity to really affect the quality of life of the patient throughout the treatment and after the\n treatment the difference between going through a short course of hormone therapy versus 18 months of hormone therapy massive and the side effects of hormone therapy I mean we hear about it all the time the fatigue and the hot flashes and everything that they go through it's a lot so it's kind of interesting because I think that a lot of people think about psma pet for detection but the quality of life factor is huge so it sounds like that anyone who has you know four plus four glycinate prostate cancer if they're not\n getting a psma pet scan they're getting sub-optimal care then that is correct so it's exciting that we have all these medical advancements but you know around the country it takes a while for the medical community to adopt all this our other oncologists doing short term like what is someone going to encounter being diagnosed with glycinate maybe in an academic center in a normal oncology office well the possibility of a piece of my pet scan may not even come up in the conversation you have to be prepared for that possibility usually\n when doctors are confronted with that they'll say yeah okay we're still finding problems with private insurances paying for psma pet scans and people uh that have recently been diagnosed with glycinate so those are those are definitely roadblocks what people should be prepared for is what what we had been advocating for the last 10 15 years and that is with four plus four uh people need to have definitive treatment of the prostate we prefer radiation over surgery they need to have a prophylactic radiation to their pelvic\n lymph nodes this can be done very safely now and they need to have 18 months of Androgen deprivation testosterone blockade to shrivel up and work with the radiation to optimize curates this is historically been the standard and there really was no dispute about it because the studies 10-year outcome studies show that you get the best cure rates with that approach there is still a strong surgical community that wants to operate on these individuals and the long-term outcomes with surgery alone are really sad uh\n curates with gleasonate overall are going to be around 75 80 percent with the type of hormone and radiation treatment that I outlined for you the Cure rates of Gleason 8 with surgery are in the range of 30 to 40 percent how can anyone justify that well commonly people get radiation right after surgery in these high grade tumors they'll have a positive margin and and they'll add some radiation right after and or if at the first sign of relapse and if you add radiation to surgery you'll get pretty\n good long-term control sadly these people are unnecessarily getting two treatments surgery plus radiation when they could have just done the radiation from the get-go so I always get up on my soapbox about the disadvantages of surgery and I apologize for that but to answer your question historically glycinate when we didn't have psma pet scans involved 18 months of hormone deprivation pelvic lymph node radiation and definitive radiation therapy with brachytherapy imrt or sbrt or proton therapy to the prostate itself so I know\n in a lot of doctors offices I am RT and beam radiation is a pretty big conversation but brachytherapy still isn't a big conversation because a lot of people just don't do it so can you explain what brachytherapy is and the benefits in the long-term studies well they have random minimize studies comparing brachytherapy with beam radiation showing 20 percent higher cure rates it's not terribly surprising that that would be the case because the dose that the brachytherapist can deliver with the seed implant is higher and can\n be given more safely than beaming it through healthy tissue why isn't brachytherapy more popular it is reimbursed in a fashion that just there's a disincentive for radiation therapists to use it they don't get paid very much to do brachytherapy and so it has fallen by the by a regular radiation treatment imrt all these things are very lucrative for the doctors they're work reasonably well but especially with Gleason 8 we want optimal curease we do not want to have any residual cancer left behind in the prostate and\n therefore brachytherapy should be considered the standard of care in people with high grade tumors so in brachi there's temporary seeds and permanent seeds is one better than the other they're equally good it's a skill procedure just like surgery so you have to look for someone that's done that particular type of implant a lot so that they're good at it if you have qualified people either approach is fine I think one question I've seen come up quite often is that somebody gets a psma pet\n scan they have glycinate and it's localized to the prostate but they're wondering can they do focal therapy for glycinate or is that dangerous well I think focal therapy would be fine this is one of the beauties of PSA pet scans in addition to now having biopsy outcomes and MRI outcomes color Doppler outcomes we've got psma pet scans which also give you an idea if there's any cancer on the other side of the gland so some people aren't aware of the fact that psma pet scans are fantastic for\n finding cancer throughout the body body but they're also good at finding whether there's any cancer in the prostate and where in the prostate so if we can confirm that there's no cancer in the contralateral side focal therapy is a reasonable option again you have to seek out doctors dedicated to focal therapy it's a it's an art form and you can't just you know go to someone who's in his learning curve so before psma we had three tmris which were kind of our gold standard to make sure that you know the\n disease was unilateral it was localized to the prostate how does MRI how is MRI going to be used now with psma being in the picture yeah MRI staging has become much more mainstream in the past we were just encouraging people to do it now of course we're telling people not only to do it but to try and find Qualified centers that have experience doing it right it is a very useful tool even more precise than psma inside the prostate psma is very good at determining if cancer is present MRIs very good at determining the actual\n dimensions and location patient it just has more resolution than a psma pet scan does so I I would think that probably anyone with Gleason four plus four will have had a prostate MRI before decisions are made about surgery and radiation or focal therapy or whole prostate therapy I just assumed that an MRI staging is a standard part of a modern workup for people with newly diagnosed high-risk prostate cancer Gleason four plus four today we talked about glycinate prostate cancer and there are three things that I\n want you to think about when it comes to this number one do what type of glycinate do you have is it localizes in the lymph nodes has a metastasize that particular information will change the way it is treated based off that information you decide on what type of treatments that you want to go through you know is it going to be long-term hormone therapy short course hormone therapy there are different factors at play and then the third thing I want you to think about that I think oftentimes because of the world we live in and how\n scary cancer is we don't think about quality of life afterwards prostate cancer should really be thought of more as a chronic disease than a death sentence and it's really important to hold all three factors is equally important as you heard Dr Scholl say the Cure rates are really good in Gleason 8.\n so please do your research take your time to decide on the right treatment for you and hold your quality of life is equally important if you need more information you can visit our website
