{"pageContent": "Background: The purpose of these clinical studies was to validate a Tissue Change Monitoring (TCM) algorithm in vivo. TCM is a quantitative tool for the real-time assessment of HIFU dose. TCM provides quantitative analysis of the backscatter pulse echo signals (pre and immediately post HIFU) for each individual ablative site, using ultrasonic tissue characterization as a surrogate for monitoring tissue temperature. Real-time analysis generates an energy difference parameter (\u0394E in dB) that is proportional to tissue temperature.", "metaData": {"source": "Focal therapy compared to radical prostatectomy for non-metastatic prostate cancer: a propensity score-matched study\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33504940/"}}
