{"pageContent": "Major changes in the field of prostate cancer over the last 25 years include the implementation of prostate specific antigen screening and the recognition that BRCA confers hereditary risk of prostate cancer. Quality of life and survivorship have driven risk stratification for localized prostate cancer, facilitated by molecular signatures and leading to increased acceptance of active surveillance as a mainstream treatment option. Advances in technology have improved efficacy and reduced toxicity in both radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer. Improved understanding of the androgen receptor has yielded substantially more effective therapies. Future growth areas include personalized treatment based on genomic and genetic information, theranostics radiopharmaceuticals, and more aggressive treatment of metastatic disease to include focal therapy. Multidisciplinary management between specialized urologists, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists remains central to maximizing patient outcomes.", "metaData": {"source": "Cigarette smoking is associated with an increased risk of biochemical disease recurrence, metastasis, castration-resistant prostate cancer, and mortality after radical prostatectomy: results from the SEARCH database\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24127391/"}}
