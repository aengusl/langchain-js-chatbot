{"pageContent": "Recent advances need to be highlighted in the management of both localized and metastatic prostate cancer. New early detection and molecular characterization tools are being developed to improve differentiation of their progression profiles and reduce \"overdetection\" and \"overtreatment\" of clinically \"insignificant\" cancers. In addition, the development of multi-parametric MR has improved the characterization of localized cancer and introduced the new concept of focal treatment. Finally, several treatments for metastatic cancer which is resistant to castration have recently increased the therapeutic armamentarium.", "metaData": {"source": "Treatment of early-stage prostate cancer among rural and urban patients\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23765584/"}}
