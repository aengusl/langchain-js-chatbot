{"pageContent": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) following prostate cancer therapy is a common condition that is well documented in literature. Despite the significant focus placed on ED and prostate cancer, very little is known regarding the baseline prevalence of other aspects of sexual dysfunction (SD) in this specific cohort of patients. The objective of the current manuscript was to assess the prevalence of subtypes of SD, including ED, ejaculatory dysfunction (EjD) and decreased libido among men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer. To achieve this objective, patients presenting to our clinic with a new diagnosis of prostate cancer from July 2011 and May 2012 completed the Male Sexual Health Questionnaire (MSHQ) to assess baseline sexual function. A total of 60 patients completed an MSHQ, with a mean age of 60.28 \u00b1 6.25 (range 44-73 years). Of patients surveyed, 14% reported no sexual activity within the previous month, while 53% had sex at least once weekly. The percentage of patients reporting ED, EjD and decreased sexual desire \u226550% of the time was 37, 26 and 48% respectively. Eleven to 18% of patients reported that these symptoms were 'very' or 'extremely' bothersome. Patients noted dissatisfaction with the quality of their sexual relationship, frequency of sexual activity and quality of sex in 18, 31 and 20%, respectively. Overall findings suggest that patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer experience a high rate of SD at baseline. Knowledge of these prevalence rates may assist physicians managing patient's expectations with planned therapies.", "metaData": {"source": "[Interventional Radiology in Oncology - Update 2021]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34344031/"}}
