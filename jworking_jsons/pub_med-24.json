{"pageContent": "The vast majority of men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer have clinically localized disease. Besides active surveillance in low risk cancers and open radical prostatectomy as the traditional gold standard more and more patients demand a effective tumor control through a minimally invasive approach. After the introduction of laparoscopy for the treatment of prostate cancer especially the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy gained in importance. In recent years the accuracy for cancer localisation within the prostate was considerably improved, which enables the increasing use of focal therapy techniques. In addition to the robot-assisted and conventional laparoscopic radical prostatectomy the current and future importance of cryotherapy, HIFU and vascular targeted photodynamic therapy for localized prostate cancer will be analyzed in the following review article.", "metaData": {"source": "Focal HIFU therapy for anterior compared to posterior prostate cancer lesions\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32638084/"}}
