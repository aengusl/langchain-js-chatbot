{"pageContent": "The Sexual Distress Scale (SDS) can be used to assess sexual distress in women, men, and prostate cancer (PCa) survivors. Despite its strong psychometric properties, researchers and clinicians could benefit from a short form of the scale. Two studies were conducted to develop (Study 1) and validate (Study 2) a short form of the SDS (SDS-SF) using samples of women, men, and PCa survivors from previous studies. Results of Study 1 suggested a 5-item SDS-SF. Study 2 showed that the SDS-SF items clustered in one factor with good fit across the three samples and excellent reliability. Sexual distress was associated with higher sexual bother, and poorer sexual satisfaction, sexual function, and relationship quality. The SDS-SF discriminated participants with and without distressing sexual problems. The SDS-SF facilitates the assessment of sexual distress in clinical settings by providing a quick way of screening patients with high levels of sexual distress.", "metaData": {"source": "Sexual Recovery Following Prostate Cancer: Recommendations From 2 Established Canadian Sexual Rehabilitation Clinics\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29199096/"}}
