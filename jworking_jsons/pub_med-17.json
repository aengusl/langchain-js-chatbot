{"pageContent": "Purpose: Focal therapies (FTs) are investigated within prospective studies on selected patients treated for localized prostate cancer (PCa). Benefits are preservation of genitourinary function and reduced complications, but follow-up is elaborate and is associated with uncertainty as cancer-free survival appears to be lower compared to standard radical treatments. The aim of this study was to analyse patient-reported acceptance of FT and evaluate factors associated with treatment decision regret.", "metaData": {"source": "[Treatment of localized prostate cancer with high-intensity focused ultrasound]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25588324/"}}
