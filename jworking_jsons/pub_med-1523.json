{"pageContent": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has evolved from being a reluctantly accepted novelty to the most widely adopted procedure. It reached a high popularity even before randomized trials could be carried out. Open cholecystectomy was at one time considered the ''gold standard'', only to be replaced by laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Today the same is happening with radical prostatectomy. Open radical prostatectomy (ORP) was the reference standard. Afterwards, came laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP), which matched ORP in terms of the trifecta of oncological, continence and sexual function outcomes. Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) was the next step in the evolution. Since 2000, it has become very widespread because of private practice promotion among surgeons and marketing hype by the manufacturers. Furthermore, patients ask for this operation. In the last eight years, there has been a rise in conceptual changes, especially in operative techniques, to improve outcomes following RARP. This review will focus on some of the key concepts emerged in the field of robotic surgery, to improve outcomes following RARP. The lack of randomized controlled trials makes it difficult to make true comparisons with ORP, LRP and other methods of treating localized prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "A Systematic Review of the Role of Penile Rehabilitation in Prostate Cancer Patients Receiving Radiotherapy and Androgen Deprivation Therapy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30777241/"}}
