{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer among men in the United States. While the use of prostate-specific antigen has improved the ability to screen and ultimately diagnose PCa, there still remain false positives due to noncancerous conditions in the prostate gland itself and other prognostic biomarkers for PCa are needed. Contents within extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as promising biomarkers that can give valuable information about disease state, and have the additional benefit of being acquired through noninvasive liquid biopsies. Meaningful communication between cancer cells and the microenvironment are carried by EVs, which impact important cellular processes in prostate cancer such as metastasis, immune regulation, and drug resistance.", "metaData": {"source": "Outcomes of locally advanced prostate cancer: a single institution study of 209 patients in Japan\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16847528/"}}
