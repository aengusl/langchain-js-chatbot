{"pageContent": "Previously-documented variations in patterns of care and patient outcomes suggest differences in the quality of care provided to men with prostate cancer. Herein we describe ongoing efforts to measure the quality of prostate cancer care, including the development and pilot-testing of the RAND prostate cancer quality indicators and the selection of the consensus-based Physician Performance Measurement Set for Prostate Cancer. We also summarize current payer-led initiatives aimed at measuring quality of care for men with prostate cancer. We conclude that currently-available prostate cancer quality indicators are derived from valid, consensus-based methodologies and capture clinical practices that are necessary for high-quality care in early-stage prostate cancer. Despite this promise, however, the currently available measures have several limitations that should be considered during their implementation in prostate cancer quality assessment and improvement activities.", "metaData": {"source": "Effects of quality-based procedure hospital funding reform in Ontario, Canada: An interrupted time series study\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32813687/"}}
