{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is the most common malignant neoplasm in men and the second most frequent cause of cancer death for males in the United States. Recently, emerging evidence suggests that prostate cancer stem cells (CSCs) may play a critical role in the development and progression of prostate cancer. Therefore, targeting prostate CSCs for the prevention of tumor progression and treatment of prostate cancer could become a novel strategy for better treatment of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. In this review article, we will summarize the most recent advances in the prostate CSCs field, with particular emphasis on targeting prostate CSCs to treat prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Pretreatment prostate-specific antigen velocity is associated with development of distant metastases and prostate cancer mortality in men treated with radiotherapy and androgen-deprivation therapy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18338814/"}}
