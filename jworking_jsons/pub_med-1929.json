{"pageContent": "Background: New biomarkers for early detection of cancer must pass through several phases of development. Early phases provide information on diagnostic properties but not on population benefits and harms. Prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) is a promising prostate cancer biomarker still in early development. We use simulation modeling to project the impact of adding PCA3 to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening on prostate cancer detection and mortality in the United States.", "metaData": {"source": "Active surveillance for prostate cancer with selective delayed definitive therapy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15992461/"}}
