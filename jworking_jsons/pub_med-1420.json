{"pageContent": "Following definitive local treatment for early-stage prostate cancer, preservation of erectile function has been assumed to be most likely following brachytherapy. However, recent studies have demonstrated that brachytherapy-related erectile dysfunction (ED) is more common than initially reported. The exacerbation of brachytherapy-related ED is closely related to several clinical, treatment, and dosimetric parameters including pre-implant erectile function and radiation dose to the proximal penis. The majority of patients with brachytherapy-induced ED respond favorably to oral erectogenic agents.", "metaData": {"source": "Editorial comment on: Erectile dysfunction after external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18375045/"}}
