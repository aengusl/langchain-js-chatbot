{"pageContent": "Radiotherapy has been successful in treating localized prostate cancer; however, a subset of patients will experience disease recurrence. Determination of the recurrence location must be made using pretreatment and posttreatment clinical variables, imaging, and postradiotherapy biopsy. Patients presumed to have local-only recurrence, optimal clinical risk factors, and an extended life expectancy may be considered for salvage local treatment. Current options include salvage surgery, cryoablation, and brachytherapy. Although they are associated with higher morbidity than primary therapy, salvage treatments can be effective and can still provide patients with a good oncologic and functional outcome. As these modalities continue to improve and patient selection is optimized, better results will evolve.", "metaData": {"source": "Psychotherapeutic Interventions Targeting Prostate Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review of the Literature\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31100249/"}}
