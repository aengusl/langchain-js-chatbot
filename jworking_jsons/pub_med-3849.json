{"pageContent": "Although prostate cancer is among the most common male cancers, little information is available on risk factors. The paper reviews trends in prostate cancer incidence, and possible risk factors are discussed. Incidence appears to have peaked and is predicted to stabilize at a higher level due to screening. Besides heredity, epidemiological studies on prostate cancer produce equivocal results. Lifestyle and environment are likely to have an important impact on prostate cancer risk, but significant and clinically relevant risk factors have yet to be identified.", "metaData": {"source": "[Prostate cancer]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17022571/"}}
