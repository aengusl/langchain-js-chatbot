{"pageContent": "Purpose: High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU/FUS) has expanded as a noninvasive quantifiable option for hyperthermia (HT). HT in a temperature range of 40-47 \u00b0C (thermal dose CEM43 \u2265 25) could work as a sensitizer to radiation therapy (RT). Here, we attempted to understand the tumor radiosensitization effect at the cellular level after a combination treatment of FUS+RT.", "metaData": {"source": "[An expanded technique of transrectal prostatic biopsy]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15114749/"}}
