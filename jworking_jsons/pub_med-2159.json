{"pageContent": "Purpose: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted PET/CT has become increasingly important in the management of prostate cancer, especially in localization of biochemical recurrence (BCR). PSMA-targeted PET/CT imaging with long-lived radionuclides as 89Zr (T1/2 = 78.4 h) may improve diagnostics by allowing data acquisition on later time points. In this study, we present our first clinical experience including preliminary biodistribution and dosimetry data of [89Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 PET/CT in patients with BCR of prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Socioeconomic status, urbanization grade, and prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8036179/"}}
