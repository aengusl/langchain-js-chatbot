{"pageContent": "Context: Recent studies suggested that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) followed by targeted biopsy (\"MRI-stratified pathway\") detects more clinically significant prostate cancers (csPCa) than the systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUS-Bx) pathway, but controversy persists.
