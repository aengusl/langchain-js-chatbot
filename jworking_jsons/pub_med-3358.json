{"pageContent": "Background: Due to improved imaging sensitivity, the term \"oligometastatic\" prostate cancer disease is diagnosed more often, leading to an increasing interest in metastasis-directed therapy (MDT). There are two types of radiation based MDT applied when treating oligometastatic disease: (1) stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) generally used for bone metastases; or (2) SBRT for isolated nodal oligometastases combined with prophylactic elective nodal radiotherapy. This review aims to summarize current evidence data, which may shed light on the optimal management of this heterogeneous group of patients.", "metaData": {"source": "Report of a consensus meeting on focal low dose rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22239224/"}}
