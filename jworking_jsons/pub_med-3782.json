{"pageContent": "Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, prostate cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer related mortality in men. Prognosis is variable and dependent on several clinical and genetic factors, including BRCA gene mutations. Recent clinical studies have reported that BRCA-associated prostate cancer is a more aggressive subtype with a higher probability of nodal involvement and distant metastases at the time of diagnosis, but radiological findings have not been described. Accurate recognition of those tumors could help guide clinical management and prompt testing and counseling for BRCA mutations. We have recently encountered four patients with BRCA-associated prostate cancer who underwent multiparametric MRI. The MRI appearances of these tumors, which were generally locally advanced and aggressive in appearance, are presented to facilitate recognition of BRCA-associated prostate cancer and guide potential genetic testing and counseling.", "metaData": {"source": "[Hypermethylation and prostate cancer]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20538204/"}}
