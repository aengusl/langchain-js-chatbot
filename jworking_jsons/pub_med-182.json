{"pageContent": "Two devices are currently available for the treatment of prostate cancer with HIFU: Sonablate\u00ae and Ablatherm\u00ae. The outcomes achieved for primary-care patient are very promissing with mid- and long-term progression-free survival rates around 70%, negative postoperative prostate biopsies almost 85%, and an excellent morbidity profile. Moreover, HIFU has a considerable potential for local recurrence after radiation failure. Recently, some early experiences on focal therapy suggest that HIFU could be an excellent option for highly selected patient.", "metaData": {"source": "Current status of high-intensity focused ultrasound for prostate cancer: technology, clinical outcomes, and future\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18419995/"}}
