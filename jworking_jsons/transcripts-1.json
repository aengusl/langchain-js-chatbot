{"pageContent": " foreign ladies and gentlemen and again it's a pleasure to participate in the pcri Symposium it's really been a wonderful tradition over the years and I've had some very memorable experiences uh probably of which one of the most memorable is having the piano sprung on me at the end of my talk back three years ago and that despite my playing they invited me back so I'm happy to be here this is Toronto looking at its best uh Sky Dome CN Tower it's become a beautiful International City and I really uh really welcome\n visitors so I'm going to focus on active surveillance kind of what's happening it's become a very active field my disclosures I'm going to mention briefly the products of both exact Imaging and mere scientific uh the high resolution ultrasound in the case of exact and the Sentinel assay uh and I received research support and I'm a consultant to both so today we've got real progress in a whole slew of areas related to conservative management of great group one and higher prostate cancer a lot better understanding of the\n molecular genetics of grade group one or Gleason 6 or pattern three they all mean the same thing compared to higher grade cancer I'll come back to this patient selection what is the impact of age and race and family history and so on the importance of germline testing particularly for DNA repair defects uh Imaging obviously MRI has been a game changer but new Imaging modalities like high resolution ultrasound and psma are both having an impact the role of biomarkers both the strengths and the limitations uh I don't\n use them very much I'll explain why not they do have a role in some situations it's quite important predictive nomograms so people have modeled surveillance compared to intervention and essentially these have shown that um uh first of all the robustness of the approach and also using clinical parameters to identify patients who are at risk for example who are at higher risk for having higher grade cancer in their prostates I'll come back to that too long-term outcomes so a criticism for at least 10 years after we first reported\n was you know you're reporting too soon you guys wait you'll see what happens the patients are going to start dying if you wait long enough and that has simply not happened and now we have many hundreds of patients probably at least 500 patients in the collective prospective series have been followed more than 15 years and there is no Cliff of mortality patients continue to do well follow-up strategies this is an area where there was a lot of heterogeneity and differences in practice these are starting to get more\n consistent as people share ideas and experience and decide how much is necessary how much is not a very fascinating area here is the tumor microenvironment and how some environmental and dietary and other influences influence the tumor microenvironment and alter the rate of proliferation and invasiveness of these cancer cells so I'll mention some of the recent data on this and finally and there's been a long-standing interest of mine and of course Marx but dietary and other innocuous interventions in men on\n surveillance and how you can actually not only improve their General Health but uh reduce the risk of prostate cancer progression often with the same intervention so I'll cover a lot of this over the next 40 minutes or so uh just I mean this is a scientific talk I've tried to Target it to a level of uh informed um scientifically literate lay people but just some acronyms uh PCA for prostate cancer GG for grade group grade group one is Gleason six now we've changed the uh the lingo for those who are new to\n this used to be called Gleason sixth now it's great group one the main reason for this is people would hear Gleason 6 which is the lowest Gleason score and their interpretation was okay I'm 60 of the weight of the Grave whereas hearing there are one out of five is much more reassuring and is actually much more accurate grade group two Gleason seven and so on OS for overall survival CSS cancer specific survive of the likelihood in other words of not dying of the cancer progression-free survival the likelihood\n that the disease is stable without evidence of new disease showing up somewhere PFS as fractus events ultrasound and this uh I'll just explain what this Forest plot is this is how in the medical field we display huge amounts of data very concisely so this is an example each one of these lines is a clinical trial and it shows for example in each clinical trial how many deaths these are randomized trials so for example in this trial this set of Trials these patients got a steroid these got Placebo and this shows the\n likelihood of dying in this case the longer the line the greater the confidence limits the larger the square the greater the number of patients so you can see more patients tighter confidence limits and vice versa and then down here you see what's called the effect size which is what is the impact of this treatment on for example reducing mortality and the size of the diamond is the the kind of confidence limits or the uncertainty so I just I'm going to show a few of these and just so you you're not completely bewildered by\n it it's very useful technique for summarizing in this case you know what did the seven trials show that studied this question okay so now on to the topic so it's really been an amazing journey over the last 20 years from a great deal of pushback against the concept of conservative management patients are going to die this is not safe it's not ethical Etc to really now widespread acceptance all over the world these are each Regional guideline groups nccn in the U.\n S the Consortium AUA ASCO and Astro it's a radiation oncology this is medical oncology the Canadian Association Europe Japan Australia everyone has adopted active surveillance as the standard of care for grade group one prostate cancer there's an active surveillance aircraft I believe pcri paid for this out of their Research Foundation Mark you can comment on that later but uh no this has really been an amazing consensus that's developed there was a bit of a political foofer all earlier this year when nccn changed active surveillance as\n the indicated treatment of choice to one of three surgery radiation or active surveillance for grade group one and there was a massive pushback and they actually flipped back and now it's once again considered the standard of care uh I think the reason for the flip-flop initially was there was concern there are patients who should be treated and I'll come back to that so uh always for these groups the question is how binding is the recommendation I think that's what drove that transient change in the\n recommendation so I thought you know this is kind of an overview I'd just give a little bit of the history one slide so this goes back to a meeting that I had with two Pals of mine who a radiation oncologists at my Center Sunnybrook Richard Chu and Cyril deju and I think it was no accident some of you may have read Walters Walter isaacson's book The innovators which is about the development of the computer and it really is multi-disciplinary collaboration where you get people from different fields coming together that\n Sparks Fly so here was a urologist and a radiation and two radiation oncologists and we assigned ourselves a task by the end of the lunch to come up with some strategy to reduce over treatment of low-risk prostate cancer so we came up with this idea why not just follow the patients track the PSA repeat the biopsy treat the ones where the PSA Rises rapidly or or their grade progresses we never thought it would come to anything and I got a grant of thirty five thousand dollars from a brand new Research Foundation the Prostate Cancer\n Research Foundation of Canada and boom we were off and then five years later we uh we had our first publication this was not such an original idea I had trained with Whitmore who was kind of a giant in the previous generation before me at Sloan Kettering who coined the aphorism is cure possible when it's necessary and necessary when it's possible meaning you can cure the patients who don't need treatment because they have very slow growing cancer and in the guys who have aggressive cancer you tend to fail and\n that basically emphasizes the Primacy of tumor biology and that is a very kind of fundamental aspect of the field of oncology in general but it was considered quite revolutionary at the time there were a number of guys including Jerry chodak I would say above all who promoted this idea of conservative management but it was still a kind of either or in other words you do nothing or you treat radically and our we thought you know maybe there's a middle ground you don't have to uh deprive the patient of Curative therapy\n if they look like they have more aggressive cancer over time so that was the strategy and uh now we have about 1500 patients in the cohort we've got long follow-up in a lot of them of course many have died of old age and a few have died of prostate cancer and just to just the initial reaction Pat Walsh who was really the the god of Urology in those days who described the nerve-sparing radical prostectomy said with conviction that the Gleason 6 patients were the ideal ones for this operation because they were the least likely to have\n disease that had spread beyond the prostate therefore you were most likely to cure them we have data from that era that almost 100 percent of these low-risk patients were treated with either radical surgery or radiation and there were these very negative and personal comments like Dr klotz will be responsible for these unnecessary deaths so fortunately I have a fairly thick skin I also heard from colleagues you'll never convince American Physicians to stop operating or radiating and all that of course proved\n to be untrue uh so now it's a different world what made it a different world one thing was the U.S preventive service task force recommendation against screening due to over diagnosis and above all over treatment and that was I would say a real cold shower for those people who argue that all patients should be treated radically and so they of course reversed this and went to a neutral recommendation a few years later based largely on the adoption of active surveillance so the principle is no longer in dispute and now at meetings\n where you have folks like me involved in debate and controversy and argument is how to do it optimally who's the candidate where do you draw the line what should be the triggers for intervention and so on so that's kind of the background and we've learned a lot recently like particularly in the last less than 10 years uh first of all molecular genetics the Gleason 3 and Gleason 4 which are the two most common patterns are like night and day when it comes to molecular genetics 90 of pattern three has the\n molecular aberrations are are essentially non-existent they look like normal cells genetically it's not a hundred percent it's 90 but uh insofar as cancer is a genetic disease the more the aberrations the more aggressive the cells tend to be this is very reassuring the implication of this is that these cancers are non-metastasizing and that is also supported by extensive Worldwide Clinical evidence there's there's almost no cases out of really hundreds of thousands where a pure Gleason 3 or gray\n group one that's been treated with surgery so you've had the chance to go through the whole gland pathologically there's no hidden higher grade cancers that these go on to recur and metastasize they can invade locally they don't metastise they can invade locally and therefore they fill the strict criteria of cancer um maybe I'll come back to this slide I just kind of summarize What patients tend to answer to tend to ask uh in the clinic but I can come back to that if necessary because I'm going to cover a lot of\n those questions in my talk so this is one study from a couple of years ago that looked at this issue of genetic alterations comparing grade group one or Gleason six to higher grade cancer and they assessed what is called the the average genomic risk which is a Metascore of genetic aberrancy so this is called a heat map and this is the degree of genetic mutations and aberrations in the cancers and each one of these across the top is a cancer so this represents many hundreds of cases the second line is the Gleason score the\n light blue is grade group one the dark blue is higher grade cancer so you can see as you move from left to right this is favorable on the left this is unfavorable genomics on the right it goes from light blue to dark blue but it's not quantized in other words you got a few light blue lines out here and the worst genomic category gory you've got a few blue lines which is interesting with very favorable genomics that's another story and the data was that for grade group one two percent were in the highest AGR quartile so\n what's going on with those two percent there's another basic observation in biology that the outliers often hold the clue to what's really going on um two percent are the patients probably where their Gleason grade group one is about to switch to grade group two you get genomic alterations as a rule before you get changes in the histology or in the pathologic appearance of the cells so as soon as you have any elements of great group of Gleason four so that's great group two which is three plus four\n seven times the likelihood of having really adverse genomics and another major development and this is quite ironic in my view because this project which is called a Spore which is a uh very uh well-funded Team grant that usually involves uh six or eight different teams around the country working in the same general area led by Bill catalona who at University of Chicago who was the most uh Fierce and consistent advocate for treatment for everyone and the opponent of active surveillance for many years uh basically he saw the light eventually\n and now leads this study looking at which genetic germline factors meaning present in every cell in your body uh predict for progression to higher grade cancer so they pulled together almost six thousand patients 28 centers we were one of them I was happy to cooperate and collaborate with him and they've identified by doing whole genome sequencing in these six thousand patients it's a huge undertaking 18 variants associated with progression to higher grade cancer 15 never previously associated with prostate cancer at all and they\n developed this 269 variant genetic risk score so in other words you send in the patient sends in blood or saliva it's a bit like 23 and me or color.com if some of you are familiar with that and so they characterize the germline variants and are able to stratify patients according to the risk if they're on surveillance with great group one of being diagnosed with higher grade cancer and it really stratifies them quite widely and I just emphasize this is the first study to come out of this major initiative\n just published within the last six or eight months and we're going to hear a lot more about this so this is kind of the germline approach to risk uh just some of the more recent data on outcome uh this is from the Hopkins group uh 1800 patients median follow-up five years but many of them followed from 10 to 15 years or more the prostate cancer mortality one in a thousand at 10 and 15 years now who are those guys they are the guys who had a very aggressive cancer at the time of diagnosis which was missed on biopsy it happens and\n probably those cancers had already metastasized at the time of diagnosis and the patients really wouldn't have likely done any better even if they'd been identified and treated radically right at the start but again one in a thousand is uh such a favorable proportion it's very reassuring and now the proportion of patients who are treated has is somewhere around a third at 15 years we think this is going to go down going forward as we get better at stratifying patients from the start with imaging a lot of this data reflects\n pre-imaging results this is another recent group from Sloan Kettering 2 900 patients 2664 were great group one and I just want to emphasize these two lines here the blue line is the rate of upgrading the orange the orange line is the likelihood that patients were treated it's the same so the laudable thing that the Memorial Sloan Kettering group has done and we have done the same the only reason to treat patients is for upgrading to higher grade cancer in in other words presence of pattern four or five not for PSA kinetics not for a\n biopsy that shows more grade group one and that is the strategy that makes sense at this point and they're the metastrate 1.5 percent still very low although higher than the Hopkins group and this is largely because they were more inclusive in terms of including uh somewhat higher risk patients the question that often comes up what about men who are very young say patients who are age 50 or 45 who have a 40-year life expectancy is it safe what about those with a strong family history so the message is it's still safe in\n fact actually makes more sense in younger men for two reasons one is they are the loss of erectile function with treatment is more of a an issue obviously for a for a 50 year old and a 70 year old rightly or wrongly and second uh high grade cancer tends to develop with age so younger men are much less likely to be harboring higher grade cancer so in a sense it's a safer strategy in the younger men which is kind of the opposite of what you might think so this was a collaboration between us and the group at Harvard more than 400\n men under age 60 on surveillance and basically no difference in intervention rate progression rate the fact that the younger doesn't mean they have more aggressive disease it's actually the opposite they're less likely to Harbor higher grade cancer and almost no deaths in this whole group and then Race So race does have an impact and and mainly for for reasons that are not completely understood but that are probably largely genetic uh there are differences for example in the structure of the Androgen receptor\n which is a key molecule involved in the development and progression of prostate cancer between races uh black men seem to be more likely to Harbor higher grade cancer so if you find grade group one in African-American you have to remember that their likelihood of of harboring a hybrid cancer is higher about 10 or 15 percent higher however if you look at the likelihood of a bad outcome the likelihood of developing metastasis or of dying of prostate cancer it's still virtually zero so these men absolutely should be\n offered active surveillance it should still be the standard of care it's just they have at this point in time as far as we can tell a modestly increased rate of being found to have higher grade cancer and requiring treatment the next special group is the group with DNA repair defect mutations in their germ line so um I I'm I'm hoping that people are somewhat familiar with this now the most important of these genes there's about 10 of them but the one that's best known is called bracket two and this is\n relevant in both prostate and breast cancer and the DNA repair pathway as the name suggests is responsible for repairing mistakes that are made in replication of the DNA every time a cell divides and we have about a billion base pairs and the likelihood of us a mistake in any one base pair is around one in a million so it's quite common to have these errors in replication but fortunately our bodies have a mechanism a molecular pathway there's actually several of them that identify and correct these mistakes\n but you so what happens in the sporadic situation where there's no mutation you gradually over a long period of time yet loss of some key what are called tumor suppressor genes you get acquisition of some oncogenes that are cancer promoting but it takes 10 to 15 years and that's the kind of typical time course for progression of prostate cancer whereas if the patient has one of these mutations in the DNA repair pathway like bracket two as soon as you get the initial Inception of the cancer boom all hell breaks loose you get this explosive\n accumulation of mutational events uh over a very short period because the repair mechanism is faulty and you can appreciate that if you diagnose grade group one cancer you're thinking gonna follow the patient for for the next 15 years safely that is not likely to be the case if they've got these uh bracha mutations and there's there's only a little bit of clinical evidence for this now we know a lot about the pathways this is one study from Hopkins 26 men with braca or ATM mutations kind of the same pathway\n um you can see here the likelihood HR is the the the increased risk Hazard ratio for developing higher grade cancer with the patients with the bracket 2 mutation compared to normal is almost three times greater so let's see here it's 80 percent at 10 years it's plausible to me that they missed 20 it's actually more like a hundred percent so these guys should in my opinion and most people's right now should not get active surveillance they should be treated even if they have only great group one\n prostate cancer and mostly treated with surgery um there are only about five percent of the population so it doesn't apply to most men but when you do find these germline mutations it has implications for the whole family because these are inherited mutations so finding a bracha mutation or one of the other ones in in a patient means that the children should be tested uh and other relatives potentially it's quite meaningful and and important information it's become quite inexpensive to screen for this now you can do it through one\n of the commercial companies like color.com or invitai for only a few hundred dollars we now are pretty much screening all our active surveillance patients for these uh DNA repair mutations uh the next question is how important is it to have close follow-up so some of our patients agree to the serial biopsies we don't do it very often but we do a second biopsy one year after the initial diagnostic biopsy and then now about every four to five years used to be a little more often we went back and said did it make a difference\n and you know there's very few examples in the whole field of oncology where how you follow the patient really has been shown to make a difference in terms of survival and mortality and somewhat to our surprise it did so the the red is the patients who complied with the protocol they had their biopsies the black as the patient said no way I'm not having another biopsy I don't care what you say or they disappeared and they had a very significant increase in uh their rate of progression this is metastasis\n free survival in the rate of prostate cancer mortality and even overall mortality so patients do need to be followed the biopsy is still important although much less often than we used to do it and I think that this just emphasized that point the next topic is Imaging so uh traditionally we did biopsies systematically Guided by conventional ultrasound 12 cores was the standard a million biopsies a year in the U.\n S but the ultrasound conventional ultrasound is good for Imaging the outlines of the prostate and you can imagine it could help you guide the needle into different parts of the prostate but it was not useful unless you had a huge cancer you really couldn't see it by ultrasound so of course MRI has been has had a huge impact this is I I like this case because it's so illustrative this is a guy whose systematic biopsy showed one positive Core 10 percent grade group one or Gleason six in the old days we might have repeated his biopsy probably\n wouldn't have found much now he gets the MRI there is the lesion right at the top there's no way you would ever hit that with a systematic biopsy unless you really had the luck of the Gods but now he has MRI targeted biopsy showed Gleason four plus three he has a radical prosthetic great big aggressive cancer in the anterior prostate which is actually quite common place for these to hide and there's his totally insignificant uh grade group one cancer that was the one found on the biopsy so you can\n appreciate kind of writ large that MRIs having has had and continues to have a Major Impact but it's not perfect I'm just going to emphasize the limitations which is not to say it's not tremendously useful just it has limitations so it's not real time the patient has the MRI then it's reviewed by the radiologist if he needs a biopsy there has to be a fusion process where the MRI image is kind of superimposed on the ultrasound image it requires a specialized radiologist with a uh a lot of expertise that takes time to develop\n treatments and biopsies can cause artifacts it misses lesions it's expensive in many parts of the world you can't get an MRI for the average patient it's just no access to it some patients are claustrophobic some have pacemakers or hip implants they can't have an MRI Insurance can be a barrier it underestimates volume so this is from a center of excellence showing that the average volume on MRI of the cancers is underestimated by about a third in this study the average estimate was 1.6 cubic centimeters by MRI 2.4 when\n you actually took out the prostate so you have to take that into account that it tends to show it doesn't show the margins of the lesion very well and it misses lesions so another report from a center of excellence in 588 men who had an MRI followed by surgery and had home mounts so you could actually see exactly where the cancers were how did they correspond to the MRI and the shocking thing at least to me was that in men who had more than one cancer so this is the multifocal prostate cancer scenario which is the\n the norm most most patients prostates if they have significant cancer have more than one site uh if the cancers were less than a centimeter 80 percent were missed if they were one to two centimeters fifty percent were missed so MRI misses a lot of cancers particularly the smaller ones and this is from Sloan Kettering showing the performance of MRI in men who had a biopsy at an MRI at Baseline and then three years later had another MRI and another biopsy and again the disappointing thing and the men whose MRI was completely stable\n a third of them despite the stable MRI were upgraded to great group two or higher so you can't just sit quietly with your negative MRI or stable MRI and assume that nothing is happening so that's where I think there's been some progress in this area I'm very enthusiastic about this novel technology called high resolution micro ultrasound so the difference between this and conventional ultrasound is it the the megahertz the frequency is 29 million Hertz per second versus conventional ultrasound is six to\n nine so what that does is it improves the resolution to 70 microns which is 0.07 of a millimeter compared to 200 microns or 0.2 of a millimeter with conventional ultrasound and why that's so important is because the ductal anatomy of the prostate uh the anatomy the prostate is a gland it's secretory it's full of ducts and the key change with cancer is loss of the ductal Anatomy that's why you see it on MRI and that's why you can see the cancer with this high resolution ultrasound you don't see these changes with\n conventional ultrasound it kind of looks feels like a normal ultrasound machine the cost is in the same ballpark and just some examples this is conventional and this is high resolution uh in the same patient and there's really you see details here that you simply don't see conventionally and you can you do use use transperrineal biopsy different techniques stepper arm or template and this is just an example so here's the prostate on ultrasound and there is the lesion now you would not expect to see this with conventional ultrasound so\n if you were doing this the kind of the way it's been done for the last few years the patient would have an MRI the lesion would probably show up an MRI and then the radiologist let me just stop this too distracting the Radiologists outlines and superimposes this image on the conventional ultrasound that's called Fusion targeting and you hope it's done accurately whereas here you see the lesions so about 80 percent of the time when it's visible on MRI it's visible on ultrasound and there's no question you\n have accurately targeted that lesion and this is uh uh publication of mine which was the initial experience from the first centers who started using this and despite the fact that a lot of these centers were still on the learning curve the sensitivity of the ultrasound this is sensitivity on the top and specificity on the bottom so the sensitivity meaning the the accuracy with which it finds cancer if it's present was actually better with ultrasound than MRI the specificity meaning if it shows something suspicious How likely is that\n to really be a cancer was about the same and now there's some actual more mature data from uh this is a center in Milan that was rigorously blinded to the MRI findings and basically the ultrasound performed just as well as the MRI so this is for each level of abnormality these are five out of five so very suspicious lesions on Primus is ultrasound pyrads is MRI basically for each score the likelihood of finding significant cancer which is the brown is exactly the same uh of course it's a lot cheaper than MRI\n it's a lot more available and uh it's really very complimentary not going to replace MRI but it's a very useful tool I just talked briefly about how the biopsy is done so for uh approximately uh uh 40 years now 30 35 years anyway biopsies have been done with trans-rectal approach and only recently has the technology become widely available to do it with transperrineal approach and the basic problem with trans rectal it's nice in a way because the needle goes directly from the rectum into the prostate but\n you're taking basically a sterile needle you're putting it through poop and then putting it into the sterile prostate and that causes infection and bleeding not infrequently and there's even a rate of mortality which is somewhere great less than one in a thousand but more than one in ten thousand and it's simply too high these are typically healthy patients so it's a little easier to Target but overall once one acquires the skill set transparaneal is equivalent and here's here's some trial data showing that uh\n whether it's randomized trials or observational studies the accuracy of this is again one of these Forest plots the accuracy of trans perennial and trans rectal is the same so we should switch and this is a to me a a very compelling story from Norway so uh this is the wife and mother of this Norwegian guy rora Gilbertson who had a trans rectal biopsy and got acute infection or sepsis and died a healthy guy and his his wife and daughter uh found out about the alternative and were so outraged that they mounted a public relations\n campaign this is from the front page of a Norwegian newspaper and they got the public on side and essentially almost overnight trans rectal biopsies disappeared from Norway and now a hundred percent of the biopsies that are done trends transparentially and we need to I would like to see this transition take place in the United States and Canada but without the public outrage so we need to in my view we need to adopt this uh uh as a profession what about intermediate risk disease expanding the boundaries for surveillance well I mentioned at the\n start that Gleason 4 pattern you can't be so confident that the molecular genetics are favorable uh they they can be and in fact many grade group 2 cancers which is a combination of three plus four but primarily pattern three are indolent uh however our experience we were very inclusive with surveillance from the start we had about 250 grade group 2 cancers and 30 percent of them went on to metastasis at 15 years this is way too high it was pre-mri pre-biomarker uh the key thing here is the percentage pattern for if it's a very small amount\n of pattern for these patients basically should be treated as if they were grade group one if it's more than five percent this is where the molecular biomarkers come in try and get a sense does this cancer have favorable genomics or not and also focal therapy is an option here so this leads me to the next aspect of this which is the molecular biomarkers this is a huge field you can look at protein DNA RNA you can look at blood at urine at uh of course semen is an obvious candidate for prostate cancer biomarkers that we're\n just beginning to examine semen as a source for molecular biomarkers but first of all just to show you don't actually need the really uh sophisticated and often expensive genetic biomarkers to get a handle on a patient's likelihood of having higher grade cancer so this is a new nomogram from the canary past Group which is a Consortium based on the west coast biopsy risk calculator so it takes readily available factors age BMI PSA prostate volume time since diagnosis maximum core ratio What proportion of\n the core was involved by cancer and gives actually a very tight reading for the likelihood of the patient being upgraded on their next biopsy so this should be more widely used in my opinion freely available patients can look it up themselves put in their own data if they have it and then you have this huge initiative develop molecular genetic biomarkers these are the ones that are commercially available they're in blood they're in urine and they're in tissue so far done in semen that are commercially available\n they're not cheap the tissue-based ones are in the four to five thousand dollar range the liquid ones in blood and urine tend to be around five to seven hundred dollars they're all trying to do the same thing which is find the patient diagnosed with grade group one cancer who's actually got more aggressive disease particularly great group two or higher you can see this is kind of this is called area under the curve or the accuracy somewhere around 0.75 to 0.\n 9 uh they're they haven't been compared head to head at all uh so the differences here cannot be relied upon they they all work to some degree and there's more coming down the pipe uh particularly these these liquid assays uh circulating tumor cell-based assays free DNA assays and so on the tissue-based assays are the ones that uh have a role in the patient with intermediate risk cancers considering considering surveillance they haven't really caught on for the average grade group one patient and the main reason\n for this is the limitation of something called tumor heterogeneity so there's now many studies that document this this is one of them so this is a group of about 40 patients each one of which had at least two to three individual cancers in their prostate the average was four so they the group dissected out each one of these cancers separately and then they did what's called whole exome sequencing so they analyzed the genetic sequences in those Cancers and they looked how much how often were they see the abnormalities\n shared and how often were they unique and what is striking the gray is the unique ones the brown is the shared ones 95 of the mutations these are different genes that are involved in prostate cancer 95 of the mutations were unique so you do your biopsy it shows grade group one the patient may have another cancer present in his prostate it is in most cases not going to share the mutations that you find in the cancer you're examining and so that's a kind of conceptual limitation and why I think the liquid biomarkers\n have more of a future because they don't have that problem of sampling the one that I'm involved in is called The Sentinel assay which examines urinary exosome micro rnas these are this is RNA that shed into the urine in exosomes which are these tiny vesicles that are shed by cells and just a this is what the exosomes look like a given cancer cell May shed thousands of these per day they're extremely small and they contain important biological material and because the assay looks at more than 400 sequences each one of whom\n is predictive this has given a tremendous predictive accuracy so here you see the accuracy compared to the other assays I showed where this was like 0.75 to 0.9 here it's 0.96 for the likelihood of finding gray group 2 or higher cancer 0.97 for any cancer hard to do a whole lot better than that now this is preliminary data still needs to be validated but this just gives you an idea of what is coming down the pipe and what This lends itself to is what's called Dynamic risk profiling which means instead of doing a biopsy every\n few years or even instead of having to image the patient every few years you just do the urine test if the test is negative you follow the patient if the test provides a signal that there's something going on in terms of significant cancer then you may have to go back re-image and re-biopsy but if that pans out that will make surveillance so much more appealing imagine a test with 97 percent accuracy that only requires a urine specimen it would really it would really enhance the appeal of this approach the final topic I'm going to address is\n innocuous interventions can we prevent failure or progression or do something good for the patient and why do this multiple reasons the the typical type a male doesn't like the passivity of surveillance they want to feel like they're doing something to help a lot of these proposed interventions do other things for the patient's health and I think as as a physician if you uh if you can induce the patient to take on these other interventions you do more for their health then you will by treating their by\n managing their prostate cancer and maybe you can actually reduce the risk of progression so there's two groups of these these ones are the motherhood ones number one stop smoking everybody knows this but a patient who's newly diagnosed with prostate cancer if the doctor spends two minutes telling him to stop that's been shown to have a favorable effect on smoking behavior that is the most cost effective intervention in all of Medicine uh my colleagues need to do more of this and I think that's really important\n regular exercise I'll come back to that and dietary modification again wait don't avoid obesity not too much red meat fruits and vegetables coming back to exercise so this is just summarizes the eight different molecular pathways that have been demonstrated to be favorably influenced by exercise in prostate cancer related to the levels of things like growth factors something called epigenetic modulation hormonal levels the tumor microenvironment and so on but now we actually have some clinical evidence for\n this a lot of that comes from pre-clinical studies animal studies and so on just within the last year this randomized study in men on surveillance of the effect of intensive exercise compared to a pamphlet so this was a small study 52 men uh the the half of them got high intensity interval training HIIT which meant they had a trainer they had phone calls they were constantly harassed to exercise at a high level the other group got just uh basically yeah you should exercise which didn't have much impact and uh not surprisingly the group that\n exercised regularly had improved cardiovascular fitness but their PSAs went down and their PSA velocity went down their PSA doubling time was more favorable and their testosterone improved so here's uh a small study but with a prostate cancer endpoint of PSA and PSA kinetics that's showed a favorable pardon me a favorable benefit so this is a kind of pilot study but it's really got people excited because it actually showed evidence of a benefit I referred earlier to the tumor microenvironment this is an amazing\n study for those of you who are who have a serious interest in this area this is New England Journal publication from last year wrath mail and this for everyone knows or Mo the people in the field certainly know that obesity is not good for prostate cancer obese men have a higher rate of prostate cancer metastasis of more advanced disease of prostate cancer mortality now for the first time we know why that is and it's quite a fascinating story so it turns out in obese men there is a metabolic tug of war between the tumor cells and the immune\n cells which are called the T cells for these crucial lipid substrates that are required for normal cellular metabolism the tumor cells basically grab all the free fatty acids and the tumor infiltrating cells the immunocytes that regulate tumor growth are deprived and their immune function is impaired and this results in impaired tumor surveillance and anti-tumor Immunity this is why obesity is associated with an increased rate of prostate cancer because it impairs cellular immunity and uh I think this is a a really important step in our\n understanding of how this works the next issue is Diet should patients who are diagnosed uh change their diet should they become vegetarians or vegans or or whatever and so this has now been tested in a prospective randomized trial called the meal trial almost 500 patients randomized between vegetarian-based Diet with counseling and phone calls Etc and a pamphlet and the primary outcome was a prostate cancer outcome PSA kinetics and biopsy now everyone knows I think that the diet over your lifetime influences\n your health and uh the question is once you're diagnosed with prostate cancer does it make a difference sadly it made no difference whatsoever there was absolutely no impact of the dietary switch to vegetarian diet either in PSA levels PSA rate of rise or upgrading on follow-up biopsy so again this doesn't mean the diet doesn't matter I think what it does mean is that in the in the two to three year time frame um it probably doesn't make much difference once you're diagnosed maybe it's just too late\n so a healthy diet is good probably not going to make that much difference I just tell patients eat a heart healthy diet avoid obesity and then finally last part of my talk is for those guys who really want to be proactive who want to do something they say I hear this all the time what can I do there have got to be something I can do to stop this thing from getting worse so there's three interventions I emphasize that none of these are supported by controlled trials yet although some trials are going on uh\n as we speak so the first one is vitamin D in Northern parts of the world or or polar parts of the world vitamin D deficiency is ubiquitous in older people they don't get enough sunlight and there is a ton of data from mainly epidemiologic studies that low levels of vitamin D are associated with higher rate of prostate cancer mortality so this is prostate cancer mortality by vitamin D level a bunch of individual trials there's the effect size about a 10 percent increase in mortality a nice thing about vitamin D is it's really\n cheap it's harmless and patience in general who don't get enough sunlight I believe should be on a vitamin D supplement around a total of around 1500 units per day the next one is Statin use I know this is of course a long-standing interest of Marx and of mine there's a lot of epidemiologic data it's the same story that men who are on a Statin have lower rates of prostate cancer metastasis all cause mortality probably in part for the cardiovascular benefit but even prostate cancer mortality and why is\n this these statins interfere with a pathway called the movalinate pathway that leads to a number of molecules that stimulate prostate cancer proliferation and invasion so aside from the cardiovascular benefits of statins there's the prostate cancer benefit I'm very prostatin I think all men middle-aged men or most should be on a Statin at least low dose and certainly if they're diagnosed with prostate cancer Mark and I have been planning a study for many years of statins and Men on active surveillance\n and I hope we're going to get around to it shortly and then finally there's the metformin story uh metformin has a favorable effect on this is a diabetes drug but it has a both a favorable effect on prostate cancer growth and progression both through a direct mechanism by basically stressing the cells metabolically it it it kind of fools the cells into thinking the cells are starving which has some benefits in terms of uh reducing the likelihood that the cells will uh will proliferate and an indirect effect by reducing some of\n the signaling Pathways like mtor and Insulin signaling Pathways that tend to stimulate cell growth and there's a lot of data on this we're doing a randomized study of this uh in in Canada in men on surveillance but this was a a a systematic review of the topic in more than 1.\n 6 million patients so just massive Collective population and that showed the likelihood of this is a recurrence-free survival of cancer-specific survival the metformin patients who were mostly diabetics but they had reduced rate of prostate cancer mortality so you know it's a safe drug to take even if you're not a diabetic and I don't really encourage it until we have recent until we have actually direct data from randomized trials which we'll have in a few years but I do think it's likely a benefit and then this to\n just to show the adoption of active surveillance over time the blue is the increased utilization of surveillance all through United States Southwest Northeast Midwest still some ways to go in Canada it's about 90 percent in the U.S overall around 60 percent but it's trending in the right direction so I think I'll leave it at that uh thank you for your attention and I I know we have some time for questions and discussion [Music]\nSUMMARY \nDr. Laurence Klotz discusses active surveillance in prostate cancer in his presentation at the PCRI Symposium in Toronto.\nProgress has been made in patient selection, including the impact of age, race, family history, and germline testing.\nImaging modalities like high resolution ultrasound and PSMA have had an impact, and biomarkers have a role in some situations.\nPredictive nomograms have shown the robustness of the approach, and long-term outcomes have been positive with no cliff of mortality.\nKlotz also discusses follow-up strategies, the tumor microenvironment, and innocuous interventions that can reduce the risk of prostate cancer progression.", "metaData": {"source": "Active Surveillance in 2022 | Laurence Klotz, MD
