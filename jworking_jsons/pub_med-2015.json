{"pageContent": "Background: Improvements in detection and treatment of prostate cancer (PCa) translate into more men living with PCa, who are therefore potentially at risk of a secondly diagnosed primary tumour (SDPTs). Little is known about potential biochemical mechanisms linking PCa with the occurrence of SDPTs. The current study aims to investigate serum biomarkers of glucose and lipid metabolism and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) measured prior to PCa diagnosis and their association with the occurrence of SDPTS.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer in Pennsylvania: The role of older age at diagnosis, aggressiveness, and environmental risk factors on treatment and mortality using data from the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32212232/"}}
