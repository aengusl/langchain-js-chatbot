{"pageContent": "The optimal strategy for imaging after focal therapy for prostate cancer is evolving. This series is an initial report on the use of contrast-enhanced transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) in follow-up of patients after high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) hemiablation for prostate cancer. In 7 patients who underwent HIFU hemiablation, contrast-enhanced TRUS findings were as follows: (1) contrast-enhanced TRUS clearly showed the HIFU ablation defect as a sharply marginated nonenhancing zone in all patients; (2) contrast-enhanced TRUS identified suspicious foci of recurrent enhancement within the ablation zone in 2 patients, facilitating image-guided prostate biopsy, which showed prostate cancer; and (3) contrast-enhanced TRUS findings correlated with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and biopsy histologic findings.", "metaData": {"source": "Active surveillance failure for prostate cancer: does the delay in treatment increase the risk of urinary incontinence?\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22704315/"}}
