{"pageContent": "The diagnosis of prostate cancer for any male of any age can profoundly affect his life and that of his family. Improvements in laparoscopic devices, combined with associated surgical equipment and innovative urologic uses, have changed the treatment choices and outcomes for these types of patients. Transperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (TLRP) offers improved postoperative outcomes for patients with localized prostatic cancer, decreasing the profound postoperative effects on functional return and potency. Quantitative advantages of TLRP include increased safety, lower hospital costs, and length of stay, while qualitative advantages include increased patient satisfaction, accelerated recovery, and qualitatively improved functional return.", "metaData": {"source": "The assessment of disease aggressivity in stage D2 prostate cancer patients (review)\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2189359/"}}
