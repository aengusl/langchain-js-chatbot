{"pageContent": "The long-term outcome in patients with prostate cancer treated with palliative intent was examined in two populations from G\u00f6teborg, Sweden. The results showed a prostate-cancer-related mortality of 62%. The cumulative mortality increased over time, indicating that prostate cancer may be a slow-growing tumour, but that patients were at considerable risk for disease progression and eventual death. Dying from prostate cancer was associated with a long hospital stay and frequent demands for palliative treatments such as TURP, radiation and procedures due to upper-urinary-tract obstruction. In a subpopulation of patients who survived for more than 10 years, the cancer-related mortality was surprisingly high, 62% after noncurative treatment. Even if the patients were diagnosed before the PSA era, the above findings should be taken into account when advising patients with prostate cancer about therapy if they have a long life expectancy.", "metaData": {"source": "Emerging therapies in castrate-resistant prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19363343/"}}
