{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men, in general. Most patients diagnosed with prostate cancer have localized disease confined to the prostate. A small percentage of patients with aggressive tumors will progress to develop local, extracapsular tumor extension and distant metastases. The aim of prostate cancer management is to identify and treat those patients with aggressive disease before they develop locally advanced or metastatic disease, and to avoid overtreating indolent tumors, which are unlikely to be life threatening. Imaging has been shown to be valuable in local staging of prostate cancer and as an aid to the management of clinically significant disease. In this article, we discuss the different established imaging modalities and emerging techniques for prostate cancer imaging in patients with clinically localized disease who may be suitable for radical treatment.", "metaData": {"source": "Epigenetics-based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies: shifting the paradigm in prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36974615/"}}
