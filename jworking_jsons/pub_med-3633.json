{"pageContent": "Annually, approximately 20 million men are prostate-specific-antigen screened, and 1.3 million undergo an invasive biopsy to diagnose roughly 200,000 new cases, 50% of which end up being indolent. Approximately 30,000 men die of prostate cancer (PCa) yearly. Importantly, an estimated US$8 billion is spent on unnecessary biopsies. Thus, an integrative analysis and predictive model of prognosis is needed to help identify only lethal and aggressive forms of the disease.", "metaData": {"source": "Report of the forth Asian Prostate Cancer (A-CaP) study meeting\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31141613/"}}
