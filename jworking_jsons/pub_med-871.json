{"pageContent": "Half of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are men, yet less attention has been focused on their sexual issues despite higher rates of sexual dysfunction and infertility than the general population. Depression and IBD disease activity are the most consistently reported risk factor for sexual dysfunction among men with IBD. Methotrexate and sulfasalazine have been rarely associated with impotence. Sulfasalazine reversibly reduces male fertility. No other medications used in IBD significantly affect fertility in humans. There is no increase in adverse fetal outcomes among offspring of fathers with IBD. Patients with IBD seem to be at a higher risk for prostate cancer; therefore, screening as recommended for high-risk patients should be considered.", "metaData": {"source": "A critical evaluation of visual proportion of Gleason 4 and maximum cancer core length quantified by histopathologists\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33057024/"}}
