{"pageContent": "Background: Among men with localized high-risk prostate cancer (PCa), patients who meet very high-risk (VHR) criteria have been shown to experience worse outcomes after radical prostatectomy (RP) in a previous study. Variations of VHR criteria have been suggested to be prognostic in other single-center cohorts, but multicenter outcomes validating VHR criteria have not been described. This study was designed to validate VHR criteria for identifying which PCa patients are at greatest risk for cancer progression.", "metaData": {"source": "Stable, fragile and recreated - a qualitative study of agency in everyday life with breast and prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31746274/"}}
