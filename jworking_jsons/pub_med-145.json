{"pageContent": "The target of focal therapy (FT) in prostate cancer (PC) is partial treatment of the prostate aiming at preserving surrounding anatomical structures. The intention is to minimize typical side effects of radical treatment options combined with local tumor control. Numerous established and new technologies are used. Results of published studies showed a good safety profile, few side effects and good preservation of functional results. Oncologic long-term data are lacking so far. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is the only technology that has been studied in a published prospective randomized trial. The FT is challenged by the multifocality of PC; therefore, the quality of prostate biopsy, histopathological assessment as well as imaging are of paramount importance. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has gained increasing importance. The FT is experimental and should only be offered within clinical trials.", "metaData": {"source": "Current status of HIFU and cryotherapy in prostate cancer--a review\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16971038/"}}
