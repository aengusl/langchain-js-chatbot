{"pageContent": "We report medium-term results in men receiving primary whole-gland HIFU (WG-HIFU) and following salvage treatment. One hundred and twenty-eight patients in a single hospital were enrolled. The enrolled patients were treated with WG-HIFU for primary localized prostate cancer. Salvage treatment include androgen deprivation therapy, secondary HIFU and salvage radiation therapy. Our primary outcomes were biochemical recurrence-free survival, salvage treatment-free survival, and metastasis-free survival. Secondary outcomes included urinary incontinence, de novo erectile dysfunction, acute epididymitis, bladder neck contracture, and urethral stricture. The 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rates were 85.7%, 82.7%, and 45.2% for D'Amico low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed high risk group is the only predictor of significant shorter biochemical recurrence free survival, salvage treatment free survival, and metastasis free survival. Of 38 patients receiving salvage treatment after biochemical recurrence, 29 (76.3%) became free from biochemical recurrence. Rates of the adverse events of urinary incontinence, acute epididymitis, bladder neck contracture or urethral stricture, and de novo erectile dysfunction were 2.3%, 10.9%, 20.3%, 65.6%, respectively. In conclusion, WG-HIFU is an effective treatment option for localised prostate cancer, especially in D'Amico low- and intermediate-risk cases. The success rate of salvage treatment with radiation therapy and secondary HIFU for biochemical recurrence was acceptable. Fewer adverse events were caused by HIFU, especially incontinence and erectile dysfunction, than by radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy.", "metaData": {"source": "The utility of intraoperative contrast-enhanced ultrasound in detecting residual disease after focal HIFU for localized prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32532530/"}}
