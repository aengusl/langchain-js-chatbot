{"pageContent": "Robust and effective shape prior modeling from a set of training data remains a challenging task, since the shape variation is complicated, and shape models should preserve local details as well as handle shape noises. To address these challenges, a novel robust projective dictionary learning (RPDL) scheme is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the RPDL method integrates the dimension reduction and dictionary learning into a unified framework for shape prior modeling, which can not only learn a robust and representative dictionary with the energy preservation of the training data, but also reduce the dimensionality and computational cost via the subspace learning. In addition, the proposed RPDL algorithm is regularized by using the norm to handle the outliers and noises, and is embedded in an online framework so that of memory and time efficiency. The proposed method is employed to model prostate shape prior for the application of magnetic resonance transrectal ultrasound registration. The experimental results demonstrate that our method provides more accurate and robust shape modeling than the state-of-the-art methods do. The proposed RPDL method is applicable for modeling other organs, and hence, a general solution for the problem of shape prior modeling.", "metaData": {"source": "Prospective comparison of five mediators of the systemic response after high-intensity focused ultrasound and targeted cryoablation for localized prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19298406/"}}
