{"pageContent": "The treatment of prostate cancer presents the patient and clinician with several options. The choice of modality is often the most difficult. For low- and intermediate-risk disease, the choice is often between surgery and brachytherapy because the other major option, external-beam radiotherapy, has toxicity that generally only makes sense in the risk/benefit analysis for high-risk prostate cancer. The comparison of brachytherapy and surgery may be done on several levels. This review will focus the comparison on toxicity, the \"soft\" endpoints of biochemical relapse-free survival and clinical relapse-free survival, and the \"hard\" endpoint of prostate cancer-specific mortality.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer: screening, diagnosis and management in 2007\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18018527/"}}
