{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is an excellent target for an active vaccine-based approach based on the fact that prostate cancer cells express unique proteins which serve as highly specific targets. APC8015 (Provenge) is one such investigational therapeutic vaccine that uses autologous antigen presenting cells (APCs) loaded with a recombinant fusion protein of prostatic acid phosphatase linked to a molecule that specifically targets a receptor expressed on the surface of human APCs. Clinical trial outcomes have demonstrated activity in patients with androgen independent prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires for men who have radical surgery for prostate cancer: a conceptual review of existing instruments\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28437031/"}}
