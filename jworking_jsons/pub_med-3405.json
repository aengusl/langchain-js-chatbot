{"pageContent": "The American Cancer Society estimates approximately 268,490 new cases of prostate cancer and approximately 34,500 deaths caused by prostate cancer in the United States for 2022. Globally, a total of 1,414,259 new cases of prostate cancer and 375,304 related deaths were reported in 2020. Well-documented health disparities and inequities exist along the continuum of care for prostate cancer management-from screening to diagnostic and staging work-up, surveillance, and treatment-ultimately impacting clinical outcomes. This session-based article discusses innovative patient-centered approaches to advance equitable prostate cancer care. It begins with a review of domestic health disparities in diagnostic imaging and radiotherapy for prostate cancer, and it summarizes barriers and solutions to achieving health equity, such as equity metrics and practice quality improvement projects. Next, a global perspective is provided that describes approaches to address financial and geographic barriers to prostate cancer care, including specific examples of strategies that emphasize the use of the cheapest method of care delivery while maintaining outcomes for drug delivery and radiotherapy.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer progression.
