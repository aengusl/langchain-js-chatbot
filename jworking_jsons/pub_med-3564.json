{"pageContent": "Localized prostate cancer demonstrates tremendous heterogeneity in the natural history of the disease. To this end, although prostate cancer may be present histologically in nearly 30% of all men above the age of 50 y, the lifetime risk of developing clinically significant disease is 18% (one in six). Furthermore, the lifetime risk of dying from prostate cancer is less than 4%. Therefore, in order to avoid unnecessarily treating potentially insignificant prostate cancer, the concept of expectant management has been considered for this disease. In this brief review, we discuss the evolution of expectant management for men with localized prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "13-year outcomes following treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer in a population based cohort\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17296379/"}}
