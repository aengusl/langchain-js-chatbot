{"pageContent": "Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a prominent biomarker for prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis. Safe contrast agents able to render the expression and distribution of PSMA would facilitate early accurate screening and prognostic prediction of PCa. However, current Gd-containing nanoparticles are often limited by nonspecific redistribution in mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) and inadequate perfusion to target sites. Besides, intrinsic defects of magnetic resonance (MR) equipment also hamper their use for precisely depicting PSMA details. Herein, we devised a novel noninvasive MR/CT/NIRF multimodal contrast agent (AGGP) coordinated to a high-affinity PSMA ligand (PSMA1) to specifically detect and quantify PSMA expression in PCa lesions, which exhibited formidable tripe-modal signal augments, preferential PSMA targeting, effective MPS escaping and profitable renal-clearable behavior in living mice. Biocompatibility and histopathological studies substantiated high security of AGGP in vivo, opening the door to future opportunities for improving early-stage PCa detection and clinical implementation of more effective multifunctional nanotherapeutics.", "metaData": {"source": "Prospective Longitudinal Health-related Quality of Life Analysis of the Finnish Arm of the PRIAS Active Surveillance Cohort: 11 Years of Follow-up\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34244118/"}}
