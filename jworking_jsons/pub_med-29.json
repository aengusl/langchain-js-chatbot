{"pageContent": "Attractivity of robotic high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is based largely on the non-invasive, extremely precise nature of this high-tech robotic therapy as well as its clean, radiation free, surgical, but nevertheless, bloodless character. Today, in urological oncology, HIFU is used clinically as a therapeutic tool for the treatment of prostate cancer. Experimentally it is investigated for therapeutic use in kidney and breast cancer. Transrectal treatment of localized prostate cancer with HIFU has been under investigation since the 1990s and it is meanwhile an actively used therapy for the disease in many urological departments worldwide. Since 2000 HIFU is mostly used in combination with transurethral resection of the prostate in order to reduce prostate gland size, to facilitate effective tissue destruction and to avoid side effects. Palliative and salvage indications as well as focal therapy of prostate cancer are under investigation to extend the spectrum of HIFU indications for non invasive prostate cancer therapy.", "metaData": {"source": "Emerging HIFU applications in cancer therapy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25367011/"}}
