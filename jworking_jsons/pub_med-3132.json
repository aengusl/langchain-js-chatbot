{"pageContent": "Background: Gleason scoring (GS) has major deficiencies and a novel system of five grade groups (GS\u2a7d6; 3+4; 4+3; 8; \u2a7e9) has been recently agreed and included in the WHO 2016 classification. Although verified in radical prostatectomies using PSA relapse for outcome, it has not been validated using prostate cancer death as an outcome in biopsy series. There is debate whether an 'overall' or 'worst' GS in biopsies series should be used.", "metaData": {"source": "Examining HSD3B1 as a possible biomarker to detect prostate cancer patients who are likely to progress on ADT\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32791030/"}}
