{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy, and the second most common cause of cancer among men in the United States. The treatment of localized prostate cancer is highly controversial, with many treatment options. Brachytherapy is the permanent implantation of radioisotopes directly into the tumor. Impotence, urinary and bowel dysfunction, as well as disease progression have frequently been utilized as disease-specific measurements of quality of life (QoL) among those with localized prostate cancer. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the impact brachytherapy has on QoL from the patient's perspective. Themes emerged from the data that surrounded the physical changes attributed to the treatment, treatment choices, knowledge of the disease, receiving the diagnosis, and use of medications to control symptoms post treatment. The findings from this study can be used for patient education and to assist patients in making appropriate treatment choices.", "metaData": {"source": "Levels and patterns of self-reported and objectively-measured free-living physical activity among prostate cancer survivors: A prospective cohort study\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30516839/"}}
