{"pageContent": "Background: The Victorian Prostate Cancer Registry (Australia) revealed poorer rates of survival for men diagnosed with prostate cancer in one Victorian regional area than for men in metropolitan Melbourne. We sought to explore the perceptions and experiences of prostate cancer diagnosis, treatment, and care of men diagnosed with prostate cancer who lived in regional or metropolitan areas and of men who had not been so diagnosed. Our goal was to contribute to the evidence from which can be built continuing improvements in prostate health care.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate Cancer Patient Perspectives on the Use of Information in Treatment Decision-Making: A Systematic Review and Qualitative Meta-synthesis\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28572868/"}}
