{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease with marked variability in its natural progression and response to therapeutic interventions. It is the most commonly diagnosed visceral cancer of men living in western countries, yet it is life-threatening in only a minority of cases. Thus, appropriate patient selection for treatment based on tumor as well as patient characteristics is essential to achieve optimal outcomes. The combination of early cancer detection and technical improvements in local treatment has led to a reduction in disease burden and an increase in cancer survivorship. However, treatment failure remains common among high-risk cases.", "metaData": {"source": "Erectile dysfunction after radiotherapy for prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19657239/"}}
