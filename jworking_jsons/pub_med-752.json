{"pageContent": "Objectives: Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) of the rectosigmoid is associated with painful symptoms. When medical treatment is ineffective, surgical resection remains the standard treatment, despite significant risk of adverse events. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a minimally invasive ablative procedure. Focal One\u00ae is a transrectal HIFU (TR-HIFU) device used in prostate cancer treatment. The primary objective of this study was to confirm the feasibility of treatment with TR-HIFU in patients presenting with posterior DIE with rectosigmoid involvement. We also assessed its safety and clinical efficacy in this context.", "metaData": {"source": "Focal Therapy Is a Viable Treatment for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33849341/"}}
