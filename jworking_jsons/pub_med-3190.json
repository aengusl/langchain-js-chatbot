{"pageContent": "As molecular imaging better delineates the state of prostate cancer, clinical management will evolve. The currently licensed imaging modalities are limited by lack of specificity or sensitivity for the extent of cancer and for predicting outcome in response to therapy. Clinicians want molecular imaging that-by being more reliable in tailoring treatment and monitoring response for each patient-will become a key facet of precision medicine, surgery, and radiation therapy. Identifying patients who are candidates for specific or novel treatments is important, but equally important is the finding that a given patient may not be a good candidate for single-modality therapy. This article presents prostate cancer scenarios in which managing clinicians would welcome molecular imaging innovations to help with decision making. The potential role of newer techniques that may help fill this wish list is discussed.", "metaData": {"source": "Emphasizing the role of Wnt5a protein expression to predict favorable outcome after radical prostatectomy in patients with low-grade prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23342259/"}}
