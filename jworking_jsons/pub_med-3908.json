Therefore, in this region is extremely important to study the possible impact of adverse environmental factors on the occurrence of pathological processes, especially cancer in the population. The aim of the study was to investigate the possible factors influencing the prostate cancer morbidity among the general population in different areas of Sumy region. Screening analysis of prostate cancer morbidity among the population of Sumy region was conducted and the data of the Sumy Regional Oncology Center on the prevalence of cancer among the population of the Sumy region in the last 10 years were studied. The environmental situation of the Sumy region in recent years was studied; areas with the highest pollution of surface waters and soils were identified. Comparison of pollution of Sumy regions and prostate cancer morbidity were conducted The study of the ecological situation in Sumy region and analysis of the level of environmental pollution in some areas showed that the highest incidence of prostate cancer observed in areas with poor ecological state of water resources and soil. Significant fluctuations in the level of breast cancer morbidity in different areas of Sumy region were also found. The study showed that the incidence of prostate cancer among the population of Sumy region associated with adverse environmental factors.", "metaData": {"source": "Treatment of localized prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17342489/"}}
