{"pageContent": "Total prostatectomy remains the main treatment for intermediate risk prostate cancer with a life expectancy greater than 10 years. In other cases non-surgical treatments can be proposed: external radiotherapy (exclusive or combined anti-androgen therapy), brachytherapy with permanent implants, high frequency ultrasounds (HIFU, Ablatherm), cryotherapy or exclusive hormonal treatment. For such patients in case of biological recurrence, prostate biopsies are usually performed in order to affirm the local recurrence. The histological confirmation of persistent tumor is usually required before any treatment: salvage surgery, cryotherapy, and brachytherapy or high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). Pathologists must be aware of the histological modifications induced by these different treatments in order to ensure an optimal interpretation of the biopsies. In this review, we describe the modifications observed in the normal prostate and in cancers after these various therapeutic methods, and also after alpha reductase inhibitors proposed as treatment of benign prostate hypertrophy and prostate cancer chemoprevention.", "metaData": {"source": "First clinical experience of intra-operative high intensity focused ultrasound in patients with colorectal liver metastases: a phase I-IIa study\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25719540/"}}
