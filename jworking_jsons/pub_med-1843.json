The goal of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of CAB with bicalutamide and LH-RH agonist therapy to LH-RH agonist therapy alone.", "metaData": {"source": "Decision regret in men living with and beyond nonmetastatic prostate cancer in the United Kingdom: A population-based patient-reported outcome study\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32065691/"}}
