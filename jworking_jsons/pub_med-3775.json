{"pageContent": "With the rapidly developing use of next-generation sequencing technologies, there has been a surge in our knowledge of the genomic landscape of prostate cancer and a movement toward developing a molecular subclassification system for the disease. With this new understanding comes great clinical potential, both for the development of biomarkers as well as new therapeutic targets. Herein, we highlight the potential clinical use of recent discoveries and how they fit into our current paradigm. We describe the challenges that lie ahead as we move from genomic sequencing toward routine clinical practice and adopt precision cancer care for patients with prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "The endocannabinoid system in prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21912423/"}}
