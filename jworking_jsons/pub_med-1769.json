{"pageContent": "Aim: This qualitative study aimed to reveal symptoms and impacts among bone metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (or mCRPC) Japanese patients, prior to Radium-223 (Ra-223) treatment. Materials & Methods: Twenty-three mCRPC patients designated to receive Ra-223 and three treating physicians (Ra-223 prescribers) in Japan, were interviewed. All interview data were assessed for concept frequency, themes and saturation. Results: Forty-five percent of the patients (mean age: 75.8 years) were symptomatic at the time of enrollment. Interviews with all patients revealed 47 mCRPC symptoms, including back pain and bone-specific pain, and 45 life impacts, including worry about disease progression and the impact on daily, physical activities. Conclusion: The symptoms and impacts of living with mCRPC and the associated burden of bone metastasis and skeletal-related symptoms are varied and are important considerations for treatment.", "metaData": {"source": "[Influence of radical prostatectomy on orgasmic function]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31535816/"}}
