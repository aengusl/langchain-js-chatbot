{"pageContent": "Background and objectives: Focal high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an emerging treatment for selected men with localized prostate cancer. A limitation of HIFU is the absence of a reliable tool to measure treatment effect intraoperatively. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has been shown to be a promising modality for assessing the extent and boundaries of tissue ablation. The aim of this study was to assess the value of CEUS immediately after focal HIFU.", "metaData": {"source": "Do we have enough evidence to recommend the routine use of high-intensity focussed ultrasound for the primary and salvage treatment of prostate cancer?\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20934243/"}}
