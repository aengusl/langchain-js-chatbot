{"pageContent": " before we get into this video on focal therapy I just wanted to remind you that we have a Live in-person Free Conference for prostate cancer patients coming up on March 11th here in Los Angeles California for more information you can visit the link in the description below and sign up come meet our doctors and our faculty and we would love to see you so Dr Schultz we had many questions regarding focal therapy we've been talking about focal therapy in our latest videos but I thought we could do a deep dive on it today so first of all\n can you define what focal therapy is so some people don't realize that the standard format for prostate cancer treatment if it's surgery you take out the whole prostate if it's radiation therapy you radiate the whole prostate this is a illusion I think sometimes they're just treating where the cancer is but the capacity to know where the cancer was with Precision is of fairly recent development so to be sure that they were getting all the cancer out treat the whole gland so focal therapy is a treatment that's aimed at the tumor\n itself maybe with a margin of protection that spares a good portion of the gland can you define the different types of focal therapy I've heard focal surgery I've heard focal radiation I've heard a lot of different things and so I thought maybe we can kind of go through each one yeah I like to emphasize the importance of the doctor doing the treatment as a greater priority than the type of focal therapy there are a lot of different ways to destroy prostate tissue you can burn it with high intensity focused ultrasound\n the you can radiate a section of the prostate I haven't seen too much surgical focal therapy but the issue is the immense Precision that's needed to do this properly or you're going to be coming back to do it again if they don't get it all it's a skill a targeting skill that these doctors are learning on the Fly uh high intensity focused Ultra Sun cryo all these sorts of things there's no real program so doctors buy the equipment and then they start practicing on patients and the attraction is great because there's\n going to be a lower incidence of side effects when you treat a smaller section but making sure that the cancer is eradicated on the first go without getting collateral damage is quite an art so since there are a couple different types of focal therapy how does one find one of these doctors who can do it you know it's since it's a newer technology like you said you'd want to find the expert well I think that's the main challenge I would say some of the early focal work a lot of was done by doctors doing focal laser\n treatment there's no doubt that these methodologies will destroy the tissue eradicate the cancer but the the challenges I've already mentioned is making sure that all the cancer is eradicated and that's not always an easy proposition some of these tumors are not that well visualized on Imaging we know that they're not perfectly spherical so they may have little tendrils coming off so you may get rid of most of the cancer but not all of it so the policy of balancing out how big a margin to put\n around these tumors and the the capacity to visualize exactly where the cancer is these are skills the this urologists are oftentimes the ones that are called to do this type of treatment would train in surgery they're not trained in imaging they're not trained in in these different methodologies how do you find the right doctor well I think sometimes you might want to be looking more towards using an inner dimensional radiologist these doctors are trained in imaging and they're good at interpreting\n scans I I think one of the most exciting areas of focal therapy right now is the Advent of something a type of haifu called Tulsa Pro Tulsa Pro is a methodology to treat this spot while the patient is in the Imaging in the MRI itself and that helps doctors who may not have been trained in imaging originally because if you look at a lot of focal therapy what they're doing is they're taking the images on one side and the patient on the other side and they're looking at the images and then they're using Fusion\n techniques to try and hit where the tumor is the Tulsa Pro the patient's in the MRI itself and when they're treating the spot they can actually see it with the uh with the Imaging so that makes it a little more straightforward to do focal therapy but the doctors that are doing this are in their learning curves and and uh and it's very early on and the Advent of this technology so we're still not entirely clear in terms of how how effective it's going to be but uh it looks I'm I'm optimistic I know you\n spoke about Tulsa Pro and that being kind of a newer technology is there any like which focal therapy has been around the longest and it kind of is a little more widespread well you would think that there would be something widespread but I really can't say that there is because when you hear about say focal cryotherapy we would rely heavily on an Interventional radiologist named Duke Bond who used to practice in Ventura who's now retired there are other doctors no doubt that do cryotherapy or focal treatments but a big name\n last stop person to do just focal cryotherapy since Dr Bond retired I don't know so it's very much operator dependent and I would say that it's something where you have to really shop around and and try and find uh is I wouldn't be wedded to doing cryotherapy for example focal laser seems to be one of the more popular things or electroporation where they do these uh we call it electrocution procedures they put two wires in and they run electricity between the wires so it's not easy to uh in this wild west\n melu of growing technology to know uh you know there's just not one stop shopping with it it sounds like a real headache but the upside of course is far fewer side effects the side effects from treatment to the whole prostate with modern radiation therapy for example have really been boiled down to just problems with long-term erectile dysfunction problems with incontinence can be circumvented with avoiding surgery problems with rectal damage can be circumvented with a space or the gel that they put in the between the\n prostate in the rectal wall but erectile dysfunction continues to be a problem in erectile dysfunction is going to occur at a much lower rate with focal therapy as opposed to whole prostate therapy so when people start talking about doing focal therapy they need to consider the um what are their priorities are they still sexually active uh if and if that's a high priority then it may justify going out and shopping around uh to talk to a lot of these different focal experts and look at online reviews look at how long they've been doing it\n look at the number of cases that they've they've got under their belt the practice that they've been able to accrue on other patients and use those metrics to decide who's going to try and accomplish this focal therapy I mean the other issue of course is not everyone is going to be a candidate for focal therapy it has to be unilateral disease and it has to be visual you have to be able to see it on a scan if the doctor can't localize where it is with an MRI for example then then focal therapy is\n not a practical option so let's say that somebody does have unilateral disease and they can locate the scan but they also see a seminal vesicle invasion is there are they still eligible for that the question comes down to sometimes people even have more advanced disease even a metastatic lymph node but the disease is unilateral I think it is feasible to still do focal therapy you know the downside of doing focal therapy other than all the challenges that we've already presented is in addition the concern about the untreated portion of\n the prostate so whether the focal therapist misses something on the other side or just with time a new cancer develops on the other side because prostate cancer is common so new cancers can show up in the untreated portion of the gland that will require ongoing surveillance just like an active surveillance patient we would get an MRI once a year of the untreated prostate because if something new shows up you want to catch it at an early incurable stage but the idea of of doing focal therapy for higher Gleason scores or if\n there's some extra capsular extension or seminal vesicle evasion is still plausible I mean there's treating healthy prostate doesn't cure you better what treating healthy prostate does is buy you insurance against the cancer that's been missed because the doctors haven't scrutinized it carefully this is one of the exciting things about the Advent of these new psma pet scans is that when people get staged to make sure there's no cancer in the rest of the body and the lymph nodes and the\n bones they can also take a close look at the psma Pet Scan and make sure that there's no occult cancer on the contralateral side so if you have an MRI and a biopsy it suggests everything's on the left then the psma Pet Scan should confirm that all the diseases on the left as well and increase our confidence that focal therapy is still a viable option how often do you see patients get focal therapy and then also go maybe on like a short course hormone therapy it happens you know there are no routine policies for a focal therapy it's a\n considered an investigation or an experimental approach and the methodology is evolving because these better psma pet scans and and things are moving really quickly but it is reasonable if someone is getting treated to the lymph nodes with beam radiation either prophylactically or for because pet scan picked up a metastatic node those patients are going to get some hormone therapy at the same time going back to sexual side effects when it comes to radiation so how you said that the sexual side effects are at a much\n lower rate than if you treated the whole prostate what is a much lower rate look like for focal therapy patients well of course it's age dependent and it's dependent on whether men are already using Viagra and Cialis pills and in the prostate world we always need to reiterate that erectile dysfunction is when you take plenty of Viagra and Cialis and you still can't get an erection in the normal world if you have to take Viagra and Cialis you have erectile dysfunction but in the prostate world its inability to get an erection\n after you've already been taking pills so going into the uh this you the older men are more likely to become impotent the men that are already taking pills are more likely to become impotent if you take say a 60 year old who's not taking any Viagra Cialis who undergoes standard Curative whole prostate radiation he's looking at about a thirty thirty five percent chance of serious erectile dysfunction that won't respond to Cialis and Viagra but if someone that same person were to have focal therapy\n the risk of serious erectile dysfunction that doesn't respond to pills is probably less than 10 percent so what about urinary incontinence urinary incontinence is a risk of surgery not of radiation and the chances with radiation are one percent or less the chances with focal treatment are probably well less than one percent my other thought process is if you're leaving the prostate intact and it the prostate is producing PSA what should the PSA look like and will it produce more PSA since the whole prostate's there after the\n treatment has been done right so that gets into the whole question of how do you monitor people after focal therapy and your point is well taken because PSA levels after surgery and radiation are going to be very low perhaps in the range of 0.1 whereas if you have left a section of the prostate untreated your PSA may be running around one to two and PSA as an indicator of cancer relapse therefore is not going to be as precise and that's why we recommend getting an MRI once a year so since psma is coming\n to the Forefront and it's going to get more popular as time goes on do you see that patients will get psma scans like once a year after focal therapy instead of MRIs or you think it'll always be MRIs well the big advantage of MRIs is there's no radiation exposure whatsoever whereas psma pet scans have a component of radiation so we have been using psmas only for ambiguous situations that PSA is higher than it should be or the MRI shows a new spot or for staging purposes we're not doing them on a routine annual\n basis what would be the worst case scenario with focal therapy then so the focal therapists like to point out that if they don't get it all the first time that they can come back and do it again and that's actually true but the disappointment that comes with having to rehash a whole recurrence of prostate cancer is very stressful emotionally the second time around is not as as pristine and clear-cut as the first time around because you have to account for the previous damage from the from the therapy on the first cycle the worst\n thing that happens with focal therapy is that you're you're back to square one again a couple years cancer is back and uh the guy that did it the first time didn't get the job done and so do you now have to shop for a new doctor um is is it a more complex situation now you really want a one and done the whole idea of focal therapy is not just to punt the ball down the field and have to deal with this again in two three four years the idea is to actually eradicate it and and uh and experience the joys of\n not having to have the same risk of erectile dysfunction as you would if you treated the whole gland that being the case then how often are you seeing failures come from focal therapy so I see two situations of course we have our patients that we've referred for focal therapy and I've been very pleased with the durability of responses we've had a few patients where they've developed new cancers on the other side but we've tried to utilize highly skilled doctors and what we call Geographic misses where\n the cancer that was being treated to be cured not being cured occurring is quite rare with the experts that we've used I do see patients that have gone around the country and had focal therapies and then come see me because the cancer is back but I don't know with these doctors that are having these Geographic misses where they didn't quite get it all so to speak are whether this is a rare occurrence in their practice maybe it's just one or two cases out of a 100 or whether they're seeing this frequently because I\n don't I don't see all of their patients so I do see the situation and that's why I'm familiar with how disappointing it is if you're back to square one and you're having to figure out what to do all over again but in our own practice where we're highly selective with where we send people we've been pretty pleased with the outcomes in the patients that we've referred from focal therapy today we talked about focal therapy and prostate cancer one of the things that comes to mind is how important it is to\n know your specific stage of prostate cancer because if you know your specific stage you can choose a specific treatment vocal therapy is a very specific treatment but it is a very viable option for those who want it and who are eligible for it so we're highlighting this and yes it's not super widespread yet but it will become more over time as focal haifu and all these Technologies come to the surface in the meantime we really encourage you if you are going to do focal therapy as Dr Schulz said research your doctor read\n the reviews you can go on Yelp you can go on Google and see what type of experiences the patients have had who've been treated by this if you have more information about your more questions actually about your particular case you can visit our website pcri.org and go ahead and go to our helpline section and you can ask questions there and we'll be able to help those facilitators who are helping on helpline have been trained by our medical oncology team and they're able to answer a lot of questions again\n I do remind you that this is not advice it is Medical information so it empowers you to go to your doctor's offices and make the best quality decisions that you can also please remember that pcri is a 501c3 nonprofit so if you would like to partner with us and donate we make prostate cancer videos now they're going all around the world and if you're not able to donate you are able to do one important thing subscribe to the YouTube channel the more subscribers we have the more YouTube takes our content very\n seriously and gives it to people who are searching for prostate cancer answers on the YouTube platform again thank you so
