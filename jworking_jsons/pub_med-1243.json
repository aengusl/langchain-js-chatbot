{"pageContent": "Forty-five patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy by a standard technique modified by the author (JEP) were interviewed regarding their sexual function prior to and after the operation. Thirty-five patients were sexually potent prior to the surgery. Post-operatively, 19 patients retained erectile potency (54%), although in 15 partial erections of varying degrees were noted. In 4 of these patients, erections were not satisfactory for sexual intercourse. It is evident that a significant number of patients retained sexual function after radical prostatectomy, even when no particular attention was made to preserve the neurovascular supply.", "metaData": {"source": "Diagnosis and Treatment of Testosterone Deficiency: Updated Recommendations From the Lisbon 2018 International Consultation for Sexual Medicine\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31351915/"}}
