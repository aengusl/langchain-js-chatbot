{"pageContent": "Providing effective care for individuals with prostate cancer is an important issue for oncology nurses. However, the paucity of empirical work regarding the impact of prostate cancer presents a limitation in designing and implementing appropriate nursing interventions. This article presents the findings from a national survey of 621 Canadian men living with prostate cancer regarding the impact of their disease and the availability of support. The most frequently identified problems included sexual function, side effects, fear of dying, incontinence, anger and pain. Approximately one-third of the respondents experienced a lifestyle change, but relatively few indicated experiencing a negative impact from the changes they experienced. The majority of respondents indicated they had been informed accurately about their treatment, but dissatisfaction was expressed regarding lack of information about emotional reactions, alternative therapies, how to speak with other prostate cancer patients and the availability of counselling and self-help groups. Clearly these results have implications for oncology nurses.", "metaData": {"source": "Human immunodeficiency virus-associated prostate cancer: clinicopathological findings and outcome in a multi-institutional study\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18384640/"}}
