{"pageContent": "This cross-sectional and quantitative study was carried out with 88 traditionalist gauchos, who took part in the Farroupilha Camp in 2009. It verified their adherence to prostate cancer examination, also analyzing which variables influence in the adherence to digital rectal examination. Participants had an average age of 58.5 years, with high income and schooling level. Most (92%) lived longer in urban areas, had healthfollow-up at private health services (70.5%) and have had some preventive examination for prostate cancer (83%). The ones who had preventive examination had higher education, income and access to private health services. There was lower demand for preventive exams by those who lived most of their lives in the rural area. However, there was no relationship between the place where participants lived longer and adherence to digital rectalexamination. Findings indicate correspondence in the adherence to preventive examinations with other studies carried out in Brazil.", "metaData": {"source": "Clinical-pathological comparison of clinical prostate cancer between Japanese Americans in Hawaii and Japanese living in Japan\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10849493/"}}
