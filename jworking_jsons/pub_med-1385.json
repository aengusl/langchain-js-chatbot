{"pageContent": "The technique for radical cystoprostatectomy was modified to avoid injury to the branches of pelvic plexus that innervate the corpora cavernosa (monolateral neurovascular bundle preservation or \"Nerve sparing technique\"). The studies of Walsh and coll. demonstrated that the branches of pelvic plexus that innervate the corpora cavernosa are situated between the rectum and urethra and penetrate the urogenital diaphragm near to the muscular wall of the urethra. Injuries to the pelvic plexus can occur during 1) division of posterior pedicle of bladder (the seminal vesicle can be used as a landmark intraoperatively to avoid injury to pelvic plexus), 2) during apical dissection of prostate with transection of the urethra. The return of sexual function postoperatively is related to preservation of autonomic innervation; the excision of the neurovascular bundle on one side may prevent impotence in 68% patients. Our study was undertaken to identify the cause of impotence in men undergoing radical cystoprostatectomy with \"Nerve sparing technique\" using bulbo cavernous reflex. Our results suggest that bulbo cavernosus reflex may not be a sensitive clinical tool to establish a diagnosis of neurogenic erectile dysfunction after pelvic surgery. The Authors examine the recent neuro-uro-physiological diagnostic methods for the study of neurogenic erectile dysfunction.", "metaData": {"source": "Comparison of health-related quality of life 5 years after SPIRIT: Surgical Prostatectomy Versus Interstitial Radiation Intervention Trial\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21149658/"}}
