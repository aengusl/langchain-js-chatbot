{"pageContent": "Background: The treatment of prostate cancer has been impeded by the lack of both clinically relevant disease models and metabolic markers that track tumor progression. Hyperpolarized (HP) (13) C MR spectroscopy has emerged as a new technology to investigate the metabolic shifts in prostate cancer. In this study, we investigate the glucose reprogramming using HP (13) C pyruvate MR in a patient-derived prostate tissue slice culture (TSC) model.", "metaData": {"source": "Towards reliable diagnostics of prostate cancer via breath\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34526529/"}}
