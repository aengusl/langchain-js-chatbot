{"pageContent": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression. Recent findings indicate that miRNAs are dysregulated in human tumors, suggesting a potential role for these molecules in the pathogenesis of cancer. Thus far, only a limited number of studies have investigated miRNA expression in prostate cancer. Results from these studies indicate that miRNA expression profiles may distinguish carcinoma from non-neoplastic specimens and further classify tumors according to androgen dependence. In addition, a prognostic significance was attributed to specific miRNAs as predictors of clinical recurrence following radical prostatectomy. For a handful of miRNAs, for which a widespread dysregulation in prostate cancer was consistently found, functional investigation has been pursued in prostate cancer experimental models to establish the rationale for the development of miRNA-based therapies. A better understanding of the role exerted by specific miRNAs in the development and progression of prostate cancer is needed, as is a precise definition of their targets relevant to the disease. However, based on available findings, a possible role for miRNAs in the management of prostate cancer as novel biomarkers and new therapeutic targets or intervention tools can be envisioned.", "metaData": {"source": "Re: Comparative effectiveness of prostate cancer treatments: evaluating statistical adjustments for confounding in observational data\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21690487/"}}
