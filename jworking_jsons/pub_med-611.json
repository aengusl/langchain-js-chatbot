{"pageContent": "Currently, prostate biopsy remains the main method used to diagnose prostate cancer (PCa). The indication for the procedure is an elevated level of the serum level of the total prostate-specific antigen (PSA). However, the PSA test is organ- but not cancer-specific, and patients may undergo an unnecessary biopsy, which is an invasive procedure associated with a risk of complications. Additional tests have been developed aimed to improve the diagnostic performance of PSA for detecting PCa. They include PSA derivatives such as free PSA fraction, -2proPSA, PSA density, PHI and the free /total PSA fraction.", "metaData": {"source": "Value of enhanced transrectal ultrasound targeted biopsy for prostate cancer diagnosis: a retrospective data analysis\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22179312/"}}
