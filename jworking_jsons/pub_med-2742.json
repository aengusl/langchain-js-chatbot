{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease, with remarkably different prognosis across all stages. Increased circulating tumor cell (CTC) count (\u2265 5) using the CellSearch assay has been identified as one of the markers that can be used to predict survival, with added value beyond currently available prognostic factors. Recently, androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) detection has been associated with worse outcomes for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) treated with novel androgen receptor-signaling (ARS) inhibitors such as abiraterone and enzalutamide but not taxane chemotherapies. Areas covered: In this manuscript, the authors review the available biomarkers in CRPC and discuss emerging data on the value of CTC-derived AR-V7 status to assess prognosis and its potential role to guide treatment selection for patients with advanced prostate cancer. Expert commentary: Current evidence supports AR-V7 status as a prognostic biomarker and also as a potential predictive biomarker for patients with mCRPC. The authors expect that the incorporation of AR-V7 status and other biomarkers (e.g. AR mutations) in the sequential assessment of patients with advanced prostate cancer will lead to a more rational use of available and future therapies, with significant improvements in outcomes for our patients.", "metaData": {"source": "Development of androgen resistance in mouse mammary tumor cells can be prevented by the antiandrogen flutamide\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3822919/"}}
