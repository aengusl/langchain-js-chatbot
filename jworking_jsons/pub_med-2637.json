{"pageContent": "According to current literature, the gold standard treatment for T3 prostate cancer is the combination of radiotherapy and extended hormonotherapy. Clinical staging based on digital rectal examination seems useless nowadays, since 20% of T3 prostate cancer is overevaluated during physical examination. Prostatic MRI is extensively needed to evaluate extraprostatic extension during preoperative work-up. EAU guidelines recommend radical prostatecomy only in selected patients: less than or equal to cT3a, PSA less than 20 ng/ml and biopsy Gleason score less than or equal to 8. Carcinologic control obtained after radical prostatectomy is variable from one series to another, with biochemical free survival rate at 5, 10 and 15 years that range from 45 to 62%, 43 to 51%, and 38 to 49%. Specific survival rates at 5, 10 and 15 years are, respectively, of 84 to 98%, 85 to 91% and 76 to 84%. Surgical margins rate differ from 22 up to 61% corresponding to several operative techniques and surgeon's own experience. Regarding urinary continence, functional outcomes are in line with those of prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer. Considering erectile dysfunction, rates are linked with the type of surgery, which can be extensive or not. There is no impact on overall or specific survival of neoadjuvant treatments. One current question remains the efficacy of early adjuvant treatment after prostatectomy, especially adjuvant irradiation. Radical prostatectomy can be considered in selected cases as a viable alternative first-line treatment option. However, patients have to be warned that they may undergo complementary treatments during the postoperative course of the disease.", "metaData": {"source": "Acetylation of androgen receptor enhances coactivator binding and promotes prostate cancer cell growth\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14612401/"}}
