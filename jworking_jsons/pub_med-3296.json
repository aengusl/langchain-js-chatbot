{"pageContent": "Comprehensive cancer genome studies have revealed genetically-defined subtypes of prostate cancer with distinct truncal driver mutations. Because prostate cancer has been largely seen as a rather uniform disease, the clinical significance of this discovery remained largely obscure. However, recent findings imply distinct biological features and therapeutic vulnerabilities linked to specific truncal mutations. Here we review our current understanding of prostate cancers harboring recurrent point mutations in the ubiquitin ligase adaptor protein SPOP and discuss opportunities for future clinical translation. More specifically, activation of the androgen receptor (AR) signaling emerges as the key oncogenic pathway. SPOP-mutant prostate cancer patients respond to AR inhibition in various clinical settings. Molecular insights on how mutant SPOP promotes tumorigenesis may open more specific therapeutic avenues which, in combination with conventional AR-targeting agents, could improve the outcome of patients with SPOP-mutant prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Inflammation and prostate cancer: a future target for prevention and therapy?\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18061030/"}}
