{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer remains one of the most lethal malignancies among men worldwide. Although the primary tumor can be successfully managed by surgery and radiotherapy, advanced metastatic carcinoma requires better therapeutic approaches. In this context, a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the initiation and progression of this disease is urgently needed, leading to the identification of new diagnostic/prognostic markers and the development of more effective treatments. Herein, the current state of knowledge of prostate cancer genetic alterations is discussed, with a focus on their potential in tumor detection and staging as well as in the screening of novel therapeutics.", "metaData": {"source": "Post-Translational Modifications That Drive Prostate Cancer Progression\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33572160/"}}
