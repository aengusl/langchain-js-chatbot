In recent years, research has shown that physical activity not only protects against a number of cancer types, but is also valuable for patients undergoing cancer treatment and during the rehabilitation phase, as well as for improving function and quality of life. Regular physical activity is an effective way to reduce the side effects of cancer, resulting in part from physical inactivity and in part from the disease itself.
