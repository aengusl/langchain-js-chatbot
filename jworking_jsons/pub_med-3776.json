{"pageContent": "The aim of this study was to confirm the role of screening by determining the percentage of clinically localized prostate cancer (stage A and B) in patients with prostate cancer detected on screening and in those presenting to urologic clinic for the symptoms of urination impairment or ostalgia. During the study, 1,000 men aged > or = 50 from the community of Cepin and village of Josipovac near Osijek were examined. The subjects with elevated concentration of total prostate specific antigen and/or digital rectal examination suspect of carcinoma underwent transperineal biopsy of the prostate. Clinical staging was performed in patients with prostate cancer detected on screening, and data on clinical staging for prostate cancer patients treated during the 1996-1997 period were retrieved from patient files of the Department of Urology, University Hospital \"Osijek\". On screening, 28 (80%) patients with localized prostate cancer and seven (20%) patients with metastases were detected. In the group of patients examined on an outpatient basis for the signs and symptoms of prostatism, there were 30 (83.4%) patients with metastases and only six (16.6%) patients with localized prostate cancer. Study results indicated that an early diagnosis of prostate cancer could be made by use of noninvasive and inexpensive methods that cause no major discomfort to the patient. Accordingly, these results appear to strongly support such screening in men, if not in all those aged over 50, then at least in the otherwise healthy, 50-70 age group.", "metaData": {"source": "Promising areas of prostate cancer research\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24469850/"}}
