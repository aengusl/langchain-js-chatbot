{"pageContent": "Androgen deprivation treatment is the current standard first-line treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. For several years, docetaxel was the only treatment with a proven survival benefit for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Since docetaxel became standard of care for men with symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), three treatment virtual spaces, for treatment and drug development in CPRC, have emerged: pre-docetaxel, docetaxel combinations and post-docetaxel. Sipuleucel-T, cabazitaxel, abiraterone, enzalutamide and radium-223 have been approved in the pre- or post-docetaxel setting in metastatic CRPC during the last few years. Patients are now living longer and experiencing better quality of life. Strategies for patient selection and treatment sequencing are therefore urgently required.", "metaData": {"source": "Insufficient Lycopene Intake Is Associated With High Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Cross-Sectional Study From the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003-2010)\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34966715/"}}
