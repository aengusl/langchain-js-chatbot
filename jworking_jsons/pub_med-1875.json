{"pageContent": "The treatment of prostate cancer induces adverse effects. Although quantitative studies have evaluated the influence of these adverse effects on the quality of life, few studies have tried to gain a deeper understanding of how men live after external beam radiotherapy of localized prostate carcinoma, which is the purpose of this study. Ten men were interviewed in their homes. The narrative interviews were tape recorded and transcribed into a text. The text was analyzed qualitatively by a content analysis. To bear the emotional experience of the illness by oneself is a self-chosen strategy. Some men expressed a sense of being exposed in meetings with female caregivers. The treatment induced changes in body functions influencing daily life. In this new life situation these men are striving to reach a sense of having control, which includes control over disease progression and waning body function. Despite the negative influence of the treatment, the men are striving to become reconciled with their new life. The experience of living after external beam radiotherapy of localized prostate carcinoma could be understood as striving to reach a sense of control and becoming reconciled with a new way of life.", "metaData": {"source": "A scoping review of the characteristics and benefits of online prostate cancer communities\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33421248/"}}
