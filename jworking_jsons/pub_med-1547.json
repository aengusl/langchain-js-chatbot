{"pageContent": "Radical prostatectomy is the current standard procedure for locally confined prostate cancer and accounts for the largest portion of invasive therapies. However, a major drawback of this approach remains the frequently ensuing postoperative erectile dysfunction. This aspect represents a frequent cause of fear and concern both for the patients and their partners and has a significant impact on the choice of therapy.After bilateral sparing of the neurovascular bundles, an average of 50% of the patients is likely to complain of erectile dysfunction. It is only in the course of the first 2 years after prostatectomy that rehabilitation of erectile dysfunction can be expected. It is all the more crucial to begin with rehabilitation therapy of the erectile tissue at an early postoperative stage to the prevent an irretrievable loss of erectile function. Application of PDE-5 inhibitors as well as prostaglandins, phentolamine, or papaverine can help to induce and to support penile blood perfusion and oxygenation, thus preserving structure and function of the corpora cavernosa. All efforts must be directed towards keeping the erectile function at the level ascertained prior to the intervention.", "metaData": {"source": "Baseline potency in candidates for bilateral nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16413666/"}}
