{"pageContent": "Focal therapy (FT) may offer a promising treatment option in the field of low to intermediate risk localized prostate cancer. The aim of this concept is to combine minimal morbidity with cancer control as well as maintain the possibility of retreatment. Recent advances in MRI and targeted biopsy has improved the diagnostic pathway of prostate cancer and increased the interest in FT. However, before implementation of FT in routine clinical practice, several challenges are still to overcome including patient selection, treatment planning, post-therapy monitoring and definition of oncologic outcome surrogates. In this article, relevant questions regarding the key steps of FT are critically discussed and the main available energy modalities are analyzed taking into account their advantages and unmet needs.", "metaData": {"source": "[Diagnosis and treatment of local recurrence of prostate cancer using hystoscanning and high-intensity focused ultrasound in patients after radical prostatectomy]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25807764/"}}
