{"pageContent": "New imaging techniques are more sensitive in prostate cancer and reveal sites of disease that may never have been seen with conventional imaging, resulting in stage migration and potentially a change in the clinical management. Until long-term data provide a better understanding of the natural history of the disease defined by more sensitive imaging, patients and clinicians should recognise the considerable uncertainty about whether these improve outcomes. It is hoped that the next iteration of the TNM classification will recognise the problem in some way.", "metaData": {"source": "Nursing Considerations for Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Bone Health in Men Affected by Prostate Cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35491331/"}}
