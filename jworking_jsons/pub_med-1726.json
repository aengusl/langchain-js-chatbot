{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is a significant health problem for middle-aged and elderly men. In the United States (US), it is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and is the second leading cause of cancer death. While men of all racial and ethnic backgrounds are at risk, black men of African descent are at especially high risk. African-Caribbean men, particularly Jamaican men, have the highest rate of prostate cancer in the world. The term \"African-American\" has been used to describe all black people living in the US. Use of such broad categorization ignores the existence of subcultures within the black community. While members of the black race may share similar primary, genetic characteristics, skin color cannot be equated with attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors of particular cultural groups. Therefore, prostate cancer interventions developed for African-American men may not be effective for men of African-Caribbean descent.", "metaData": {"source": "Erectile Function Recovery After Surgery in Young Men with Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Probably Not Just a Matter of Age, Certainly Not the Main Point of Discussion\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28958826/"}}
