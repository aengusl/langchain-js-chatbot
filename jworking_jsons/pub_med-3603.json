{"pageContent": "The management of prostate cancer is a complex issue with a varying range of treatment options available. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the prostate has been available for sometime but has the limitation of only anatomical evaluation. Three-dimensional MR spectroscopy is emerging as a new and sensitive tool in the metabolic evaluation of prostate cancer. This article reviews the principle, techniques, and methods of evaluation of spectroscopy and also discusses the applications of spectroscopy in the current management of prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Sixth joint meeting of J-CaP and CaPSURE--a multinational perspective on prostate cancer management and patient outcomes\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23723314/"}}
