{"pageContent": "Purpose: Proliferative activity defined by Ki-67 staining index (SI) has been correlated with progression and prognosis in a number of malignant tumors including prostate cancer. However, few studies have examined Ki-67 SI in pretreatment diagnostic material from patients treated with definitive radiotherapy. In a prior study, we found that a Ki-67 SI of >3.5% was associated with poorer patient outcome. The goals of this analysis were to validate the prognostic value of Ki-67 SI and this cut point.", "metaData": {"source": "Demographic differences in prostate cancer incidence and stage: an examination of population diversity in California\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9631160/"}}
