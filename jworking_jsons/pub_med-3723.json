{"pageContent": "Improvements in diagnostic techniques have led to prostate cancer being diagnosed in younger patients and at an earlier stage of disease. The question therefore arises as to what is the best treatment for early prostate cancer. The main issues to be considered are whether the cancer is likely to progress quicker if these patients do not receive early treatment and what the quality of life implications are for patients receiving early treatment. As yet, due to the lack of valid comparisons of treatments, there is no clear \"best treatment\" for early prostate cancer. A number of clinical trials, comparing current treatments or investigating potential new treatment options for early prostate cancer, are in progress. The results of these should clarify the relative benefits of currently available treatments. This article reviews the latest information on the incidence, prognosis and current treatments for early prostate cancer and discusses the need for new treatments. Potential clinical benefits and cost implications of new treatments for early prostate cancer, such as improved surgical and radiotherapy techniques and adjuvant medical therapy, are also evaluated.", "metaData": {"source": "The 23rd Annual Prostate Cancer Foundation Scientific Retreat report\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28503903/"}}
