{"pageContent": "Kinetic parameters of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) play a pivotal role in diagnostic and treatment of patients with prostate cancer (PCr). Assessment of PSA doubling time (PSADT) can be used for monitoring of treatment efficacy and predicting the outcomes of disease. The aim of the present paper is to analyze the PSADT in patients with different spread of PCr. Moreover, the initial PSADTs were studied with relation to overall survival. 336 PCr patients were included into the study. PSADT was measured usng two point method. Ill patients had localized PCr (T1-2N0M0), 90--regional-local PCr (T1-2N0M0) and 136 had generalized PCr (T1-4N1-2M1).", "metaData": {"source": "Validation and clinical utility of prostate cancer biomarkers\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23459624/"}}
