MRI spectroscopy combines morphologic imaging and metabolic cartography. This combination allows a new approach for the diagnosis of prostate cancer in patients with negative biopsy and high Levels of PSA. With MRI spectroscopy the Local staging of prostate cancer has a better accuracy than with MRI alone.
