questions and through the Q a with Dr scholes and Dr moyad's moderating with the speakers will be able to answer them today what you're going to see is a previously recorded broadcast from our\n in-person conference two weeks ago but I will remind you that our helpline team is on today with our physicians able to answer your questions and so go ahead and leave them in the chat box or you can email us at info pcri.org so right now we're going to have a short invocation from a prostate cancer patient who's been a good friend of ours for many years his name is Rabbi Elliott and I'll be right back thank you Lord that one day does not go by without your oversight or understanding thank you that you are\n faithful to your own word thank you God that same word declares you as the Healer and the great physician we come to you thanking you for the other Physicians you've raised up for men and women and we ask you that your wisdom and your Insight and your plans for our health and healing would be revealed in this critical conference this very weekend bless this time dear God Amen so right now we're going to be covering Advanced prostate cancer and its side effects we have an incredible speaker her name is Dr Elizabeth Heath and she\n is the associate Center Director of translational Sciences for Karmanos Cancer Institute in Michigan she does an incredible job of contextualizing prostate cancer in an advanced category but she also talks about the different types of treatments and their individual side effects and also the importance of genetic testing in this category I hope you find this informative and if you have questions again email info pcri.\n org or leave them in the chat me I've heard about this conference for so long you guys are like the true Pioneers I've emulated a similar format in my hometown in Detroit Michigan that's how Dr moyad and I tend to cross paths and we'd love to share information and we have I think very separate practices out there in the state of Michigan but it just shows you the true diversity of this cancer you know it really doesn't care where you live what part of the country who you are your age your race your background\n it just is there so our job here and it's a little loose on the timing I think right Dr moyad it's he's like you know 10 minutes three hours go with that I said okay well my job I think is to maybe take you on this journey of where we are with all of the treatments with prostate cancer because you know what all of a sudden it got kind of complicated and the more complicated it is in a way where sometimes you're keeping up bad news the doctors are trying to keep up too so as we're keeping up we're not\n keeping up all at the same time if it's all that you do like myself in Academia maybe it comes a little easier if you're in a busy all-around practice and you're seeing a press a patient followed by breast cancer patient followed by head and neck cancer patient gets a little tough so you in the audience whether it's virtual or in person it's up to you guys to advocate for yourselves for your family for your neighbor for your community because it's going to take all of us that's why you know what was said\n on the video is so true what's important here is it's a collective Community problem and we're only going to solve it with all of us showing up a little bit about myself I've been in Michigan now for 20 years and my practice is in downtown Detroit you know if you guys are ever around come visit us we definitely have a less hectic airport I can say that 100 percent LAX is um wow that's all I have to say wow part of the things I think that you know that sense of overwhelmness happens in prostate cancer but if you have\n metastatic disease it's even more overwhelming because you feel like you hear a Time clock and maybe it's meaningful friends and family who says would you see that doctor yet did you go on that website yet did you get that supplement yet really confusing and why is that because everyone wants to help everyone wants to help everyone wants you to be better but I think knowledge and education is the first step and whether it's this conference or going on different websites it is so critical to educate yourselves and guess\n what what I say today May literally not be true in three months and in six months and our information trained so if you're me and Dr moriat and Dr Shore we check Twitter yes whether you're a Twitter person or not however you get your news there's usually something new every 24 hours so our scientific news cycle in the world of oncology is turning over almost every 24 hours and that is overwhelming for the Physicians so sometimes when I see folks the first question is how does my doctor not know this\n and it's a matter of loss of trust immediately and the answer is well he or she may not have had time to look at said website because they're doing else something else so the way to approach that is hey did you hear about the latest and what do you know and maybe give that person a little bit of time to catch up but it's got to be a team effort I could tell you what I love about giving this talk 20 years you know from when I started is there's more stuff on the slides it used to just be well it's Androgen deprivation and\n sometimes I squeak in the word chemo right Dr Schultz other than that it's well we're gonna just keep talking about hormones and no trust me we're still there but there are still other options but before we get into it there's something new that's occurred and you guys always see the slide of how many prostate cancer patients get diagnosed and how many deaths per year these numbers change the American Cancer Society does a really good job of spitting this out and you know you can find this on cancer.org\n there is a publication that the American Cancer Society has a section in their program that looks at just statistics like really solid statistics and these numbers we tend to obsess about because as a society you want to know is this thing going up is this thing going down and the good news is most people are diagnosed with local disease so you hopefully don't need me I might be the person that sits in the middle and are you for radiation are you for surgery and the answer is we walk through it we figure out what's right for you\n but we know now that metastatic disease which used to be just a line item hey it's metastatic disease you're stage four out of four what we know is that every person with stage four is different from one another the complexity not just physically it's now genomically or genetically so different and the placement of your cancer are you a four because you have a little itty bitty lymph node because you know we made the staging like that blame the pathologist I hope there's no pathologist viewing right now I will\n disclaim that but you know it's the way we just sort of put the staging but is that the same as a person with liver metastases or lots of bone metastasis no and you know that because one person might have a stage four and be quite debilitated and another person might have stage four and be perfectly fine and walking and running and doing all sorts of things around town so it's very complex so it's not a one-size-fits-all solution because you're not all the same but here's the new data literally super super up to\n date we are going the wrong way guys with prostate cancer we were doing great for a hot minute incidents and death rates we were making a difference look at what my bullet points say now the cases have increased three percent per year from 2014 to 2019. what did that say increase we're going the wrong way that is a shocker when the American Cancer Society and other cancers everyone's doing better you take cervical cancer wow that HPV vaccination has done something those numbers are way down thank goodness for your loved ones\n prostate cancer it's up the incidence rates is higher in black men than in white men we've known this but to now have that actually be higher is even more disturbing and if you look at Advanced disease which is what I'm talking about look at those numbers up up up up so how are we in this pickle uh-oh well the proportion of men diagnosed with distant stage disease has doubled in just that last time frame doubled not a two percent change nothing we are talking that we are now as a collective Community facing a different challenge\n which we may be in this pickle because we sort of got completely derailed with screening screening was sort of the most mixed messaging you can get I always say when I run our health fairs and our discussions it's the most wishy-washy answer on the planet should I get my PSA screened Dr Heath Dr Smith Dr Schultz Dr moyad well let's talk about that what are we going to talk about in the midst of your colonoscopy screening skin seat belt awareness you know all sorts of other things that you're talking\n about diabetes hypertension cholesterol with your physician are you really going to have a 30-minute discussion at shared decision making because at the end of the day they say what do you think I should do doc right so that sort of I don't really know and then the number went down and you pull a bunch of doctors in the room we're all going to give you different answers so what does that mean it means those are the numbers we're looking at so one you can see communication is critical which is why you're all here\n today and part of pcri but number two what are we gonna do about it as a community seriously so you are all involved somehow whether you're here as a patient yourself or you're here for a loved one or a friend or someone in your community as a supporter what are you going to do about this we have a real problem I put that challenge to uh Dr moyance and Schultz about what are you guys going to do about that because it's going to take the collective all of us to decide whether this is where we want to go so that my\n discussions of all the advanced prostate cancers are not what's the main issue it's the can we really reduce this number so I put that out there as sort of action item one what are you guys going to do are you going to spread the word some more now with real data like oh boy we're not screening we're in trouble everybody's coming in more advanced and the pandemic did not help so one of our events we run in Detroit is um gentlemen check your engines and we parallel up with Harley Davidson because I had a Harley-Davidson die hard\n in my practice and he has since passed but we do it every year to show up because men take care of their bikes and their cars more than they do themselves and when we say we're going to have a shared decision-making moment about PSA you all said oh that's so great I don't have to go to the doctor no no that's not what we said we're having a shared decision-making moment yeah yeah we're not going to the doctor got that thanks Dr Heath right so we need to as a collective Community think\n about that because you all know in this room that this is how we doctors think about prostate cancer so if you go from the left to the right and you say am I local am I somewhere in the middle where my PSA is going up and down and driving everybody crazy or am I really getting a lot of treatments now for my Advanced cancer how we do drug development and I've done drug development for 25 years what does that means it means I really want to get a drug that's going to cure prostate cancer so I don't have to look\n at you guys on a rainy Saturday in LA but it takes a lot of effort so how do we do that we have to think of that in these terms it's not to say you're in a box it's how we think scientifically and most of the advancements are all in the green boxes so all of these castration resistant you know we all hate that term by the way there's sort of a movement to change the term I think you all should get a vote you know for years we've been telling you you're going to have to be castrate resistant and then all of a sudden\n you're going to change it so now when you Google it's going to be another hot mess or my hormones resistant what am I a doc I don't know you're stop Googling that's probably the thing or go on pcri to get the information but part of it is all of the dollars spent is really to work on folks in the green boxes so is that important sure because you get a vote in that as part of advocacy we know that the toughest cancer to do anything about is folks in the green box it's not to say we don't have treatment\n we just need more and how much more so here's the list first of all I remember giving this lecture and we kind of literally have three boxes it was ADT a little bit more of ADT and docitaxel chemo so let's run through this because we're just going to pause here so this is the complete list so when you see your doctor no matter what stage you're in one of these doohickeys and the boxes is going to pop up in your discussion if it's needed so the things that are in orange are all chemos so I've only put generics so that it's\n you know it's easier it's how we communicate to one another so my nose Andro 1996 and you're like wow I affectionately called that Smurf juice because it can sort of make you pee blue so why is that not out there well because the data shows you don't really live longer but it does help you feel better so have I as a medical oncologist use mitozantro in my patients the answer is absolutely when needed but it is an older agent it's not to say old is no good it just means you got to think about how to\n strategize doci taxol cabazi taxol is the staple of what's in our you know toolkit so those are words you should be familiar with zippolusal tea is the first immunotherapy that was approved you know it's not for everyone but there sure is a huge audience that would benefit from sipulusal tea and all of these drugs have an FDA approval so none of this is clinical trials none of this is anything that you know you can't get these are all FDA approved drugs and then all the ones in lighter green are the hormone pills\n so some of you are maybe new today and I don't know what the hormones are we'll talk about that in a minute and some of you have heard these terms not for the last 10 years and we just keep adding more things in the green boxes because that's how we advance drug development so you have aberratorone and zolutamide apollutamide darrowlutamide those are hormone type pills then you have radium 223 which is in a box of its own I can't really tell it's a different color blue I think um but that is a radio Pharmaceutical\n that is the stuff that Marie Curie discovered all those years ago and got a Nobel Prize when I say that and I say listen my kids fifth grade you know project or gazillion years ago actually is a real drug that we give it's a shock but it's available today for the right person religolics is the new oral uh Androgen blocking drug that's sort of the instead of the shot here or here or here that's the oral equivalent let me just take a quick poll who's herded that drug religolics raise your hand\n okay so it's not the whole room right so one day it's going to be the whole room because that means you guys have been aware and educated on that is an oral version of the injectables so that's something maybe to ask your physician to see if that's something that you should consider because the side effect profile is different than the injectables and then lutishim 177 psma the Hot Topic of all Hot Topic I've never heard four letters be disgusted my practice so much than in just this past year\n everybody wants it boy or boy are we struggling with it we're going to talk about that as well and then who's heard of the red box a laparib and Rue Capri raise your hands okay that's even less than brella Golic so we're going to talk about that it's a whole brand new class of drugs that may be relevant to uh if a portion of you or is it all of you oh yeah yeah we're still figuring that out and then you have the bone drugs that are in green these are ones to strengthen your bones in case you have a lot of cancer in case\n you have thin bones which you know as we age men and women we also are at risk for fracture so these are things I want to know a show of hands anybody in the room that knows every Drug In The Box who's ever heard of it raise your hand now it's the smallest amount and your votes don't count by the way people your votes don't count if you did raise your hand I'd be really worried but I think there was maybe three out of this whole room I don't know virtually how many but it's on us to know all of them\n because you could be sitting in your doctor's office perhaps with a friend or yourself and then you say wait a minute let me let me pull up my boxes and this box might change you know if I get invited back when it's sunnier and warmer and I can walk outside without getting rained on there may be more boxes now I got to tell you our breast cancer colleagues they probably have 50 boxes so they got us beat by a lot so they've been more successful because the the women with breast cancer go on Trials\n like nobody's business you call women to action boom you call mend action you're like okay no thank you so it's gonna take you guys to tell the next person to say I was on a trial was no big deal and I was really glad I did it because I helped the next person if we don't endorse it ourselves this community to share with others we're gonna be in a bit of trouble so is it still though all about androgens uh it's all still about androgens guys no matter how many times I'm up here I can't get away from this slide just like\n estrogen drives breast cancer testosterone drives prostate cancer it doesn't matter how many times we swing that how many times we try to do drug development to not focus on that the cancer relies on that like fuel since I'm from the Motor City I think of the areas in the left which is a whole bunch of drawings that really short of some of the investigators but what do we know we know we shut down testosterone kind of the cancer stopped growing so in a motor city analogy if you put away the gas the car doesn't run\n you still got a car still hanging out in your garage on your street doesn't really go away it's not like the car gets absorbed but it doesn't run there's no gas on the right side is when the car says maybe I don't need gas I got plenty of electricity so now it moves so the car is still there and when it becomes and develops resistance it's using a different fuel to go so we now take all of those other areas coming in and all our drug development is okay I see I see something coming at me this way knock\n that guy out oh I see something else coming that way knock that guy out can't solve the issue of getting rid of the car although there are attempts to destroy it and we call those Androgen receptor degraders but it's hard to do it it's like saying we're going to get rid of all the cars on your street at any one time really hard you could take away the gas pump then the cars don't go anywhere so a lot of our drugs that you just heard of is kind of in this way now is that fun for you guys well you get to see your PSA\n drop whoo what happens to you guys though well then you're in menopause and when you're in menopause like women you get women type menopausal symptoms I call that manopause hot flashes weight gain higher cholesterol trouble with maintaining your blood sugar hypertension what is that called it's called metabolic syndrome I think Dr moyad gives an awesome lecture on metabolic syndrome and what you can do about it it's a thing you all can fight against but we're lousy at it in our world we're\n lousy we tell people we're going to now go move and and we're going to walk and we're going to do what we do in Detroit we have a CrossFit program I don't know how my guys do the CrossFit but yay bottom line is you have to fight against it and then you have to share the word that this is one way to help mitigate some of these side effects but we can't seem to get away from it there are a lot of efforts though to try to develop drugs that don't take away your testosterone so everyone feels this\n everyone knows we are just trying our darndest to come up with a path forward so it's not that we're not listening we're trying but it's really hard as a strategy to overcome so I just wanted to put that out there okay talk about what's sort of new now you guys know all of the ingredients of all the things we're going to talk the world changed a lot last year in this group so now I put it here metastatic hormone sensitive so it's kind of in the middle of that Journey box so that you are not green yet you're\n still in the blue box but you come with spread disease so with the rise now of cancer that's that we just talked about the statistics what you're gonna see is a lot more men coming with Advanced disease so what am I seeing post covid I'm sure others in here will say well I didn't know that back pain was something I thought it was just you know I'm getting older and I have back pain oh shoot now my PSAs 2000.\n and that's what I get now in my practice the I went to the ER because I thought I raked or shoveled or something and it's actually cancer in my back it's devastating but when you come there the old way of doing it was well I'm going to just provide the shot or get rid of your testosterone and some of you have actually elected for surgery is not to say taking away your testicles is not something that's happened so I want to recognize that because I have men in my practice that opt for that\n because they feel that that's what they want to do options options options as long as you know that that's what it's about and and we started throwing in chemotherapy on top of that and that was 2015 and then you see those other names that are now familiar to you aberratorone enzolutamide apollutamide and then uh oh what happened in 2021 oh yeah we just threw in now both of them together in 2022.\n so it's not that you have to know this it's to know that number one all of the things here have a survival Advantage so the message here is you need when you first show up with spread cancer you need more than an injection you need something else to go with that and I have to tell you that messaging isn't out it needs to be out it is your mission action number two you gotta spread the word that if you know somebody in this position this is important why and I don't there's no quiz on this by the way I put this to\n also show that scientifically we know everything that I just listed helps a person live longer doesn't cure anyone but you live longer so if you know that it's more than an injection and I need something else well what's the trouble Dr Heath seriously what's taken so long okay and I'm just saying this for the triplet let me tell you how we're thinking about this in big bucket terms you're single which is just your injectable or how you get rid of that testosterone remove the gas versus the double which is now doing\n that plus a pill versus the triple which is doing that plus the pill and chemo the things that are double and triple is the standard of care today so when I say there's action number two is that unfortunately the majority of people out there are still getting only the single we are leaving money on the table at every which turn that means people's survival so when you look at this and you say I don't know anything about curves I don't know what you're talking about oh there's Capital mire Hazard ratio blah\n blah trust me on a good day I don't know what I'm talking about either however what do I do know I know when things make you live longer and when you need to know that as a patient and as a loved one and we say well how do you know if it's a a double or a triple these are some of the things that your doctors are using every day to make decisions so this is the inside peak of you know you're in restaurant now let me see inside the kitchen what they're doing here's how we think about it sometimes\n it's as simple as I always use a pill because my team knows exactly how to do it ninety percent of the people have this insurance you know Bob in the front desk knows to call prior authorization and everyone gets the pill with no copay because we know these pills are anywhere from ten thousand to fifteen thousand dollars a month and if you don't know that come join me in my practice in Detroit when people have to be stuck paying co-pays and I'll just put as a plug here for the state of Michigan we have no\n oral chemotherapy parity which means that as a cancer patient your insurance might say no problem on the doci taxol not so much on the pill wait a minute let me say that again so if I was in a state that had this law as a cancer patient if my insurance covers chemo it should also do the same coverage as one of these pills that's right Dr Heath absolutely but the seven states don't have that law your insurance says yes to chemo good luck with the pill so you have structural things within each state that will be different you\n have insurance that will be different for every single man Medicare I swear I have never seen so many nuances of Medicare in my life I got that planned I didn't get this plan I have a sub plan of this and a double supplant of that no idea what they're talking about other than what do you mean it's a two thousand dollar copay every month for years unacceptable so sometimes it's well I kind of really want to give you this but your heart's not so great you got a defibrillator and a pacemaker and you've been in a\n hospital with heart failure maybe one of those pills isn't the way to go okay but guess what you get to weigh in in that decision you guys as the patience you go listen doc I I'm hearing you I'm kind of afraid of your list of Adverse Events and side effects holy mackerel maybe this isn't what we're going to do right but you know the best part of that decision you got to make it together with your physician so it's not something that you should just take and say okay that's the answer advocate for\n yourself you say listen okay that's great I was heart failure but my heart failure was 10 years ago I'm fixed now my diabetes is under control why wouldn't you entertain that for me be your own Advocate and then of course the no coverage issue push back one one company may say no you wait another few weeks you make your team go back the number of times I am reappealing is too many in case anyone's listening please make us stop doing that as doctors thank you but it's so hard you guys I'm literally on the phone\n fighting for every patient because sometimes it's a different person on the phone sometimes January one of a new year shows up and the rules change what do you mean the rules change I don't know some policy went in I'm not aware of and you had coverage and now you don't you had coverage from patient assistance and now you don't so be your own Advocate don't just take it oh we can't do this or you can't afford it not not in 2023 and then these are the these are the issues that we think of in our\n practice about well do you throw in the chemo as a triplet do you throw it in so we use things like well gosh do you have liver or lung metastasis that's what visceral Mets mean or do you just have a lot of bone mats and then we kind of worry you have high volume so if you Google Now there's a lot of that wording around high volume high risk they're two different things so high risk is are you a gleasonate who here knows his Gleason score yeah that's that's almost everybody so you know how\n now you know stuff so if you're like well shouldn't I be getting this chemo because you did that biopsy after you told me I had stage four disease and Doc I'm a Gleason 9. shouldn't I get something else or at least have a discussion I think your physician might be shocked that you asked that question but you've been empowered you know what to look for what if you have that and liver metastasis and all you need is two and you say there's data give it to me straight what am I getting single double\n or triple and let me tell you the world because now we look at what are we actually doing so there's the academic version like well Dr Heath wrote a paper Dr solo Dr Moya and we say this and then when you go okay well are the doctors doing what was said that's what real world is so we look at claims data and claims data is what you actually prescribe and who and where and and and so on these are four different sets of real world half the people that I just was talking about they don't get a double or a\n triple they're getting a single that is disappointing when you know there is a survival benefit I'm not curing anyone but the survival benefit is an additional 15 months you know in oncology you always are oh it's good two weeks two months fifteen one five so if you were getting just the double and you were just getting the single your survival will be different from one another by significant amount how are we doing globally well here's the global data everyone is doing it differently worldwide\n now some of that is because the rules are all different from each other right because if you're in Europe or you're in Spain or you're in Japan you have access to different things and the rules are different but what you see is still a large number of green boxes you know what the greens are the singles yikes so this is not a U.\n S based problem this is a global problem so you share that knowledge with everyone you got to be at least a double and for the right patient a triple and this is a nice study that Steve Friedland Dr Friedland did in terms of why don't doctors do it and I just want to get you down to that last bullet top five reasons in a chart review why people don't get the double well I'm kind of afraid Mr Smith's not going to tolerate it you might feel terrible okay but shouldn't we try it first and then Mr Smith can tell you that he feels\n terrible and you adjust hey there's lack of data that says it's not going to work I just told you tons of data I showed you all sorts of beautiful numbers what does that mean oh the data's there they're just not aware that is 31 of the people those are doctor's notes whoops we're not educating even ourselves so we're doing this again and again and again worries about payments number one concern I'm not going to go bankrupt or bankrupt my family because I have to take a pill every day\n and then also just I'll do it later so all of these are things we think about what about the triple what if the chemo let me tell you what we use as this is the look again behind in the kitchen of a restaurant what are my parameters so Dr huria who's left us far too soon was a total Pioneer in geriatric oncology and what she did was look at factors that we use in everyday practice to figure out whether you're strong enough whether you're fit enough for chemo so if you're older we kind of worry\n if you're getting a regimen that's for genital urinary cancer oh that's you guys prostate cancer genital urinary cancer we kind of worry here's another one if you fell what yeah my one question always throws everyone off have you fallen at home in the last six months and the number of times I get a well how'd you know I fell well because I know to ask the question aha and let me tell you I got a bunch of stubborn people in the state of Michigan who just feel compelled to go outside and do things himself and there's a lot\n of Falls because they're unsteady because they're weak because they don't have core strength so that's important what if you can't even walk one block so when you're looking at all of this what happens is in importance to recognize it's not just I'm willing to take the chemo that I am physically fit to take the chemo very important so why is that the higher you are on the scale the more likely you're going to have a terrible outcome with chemo including death so a grade five means you're no longer\n with us a Grade Three means you got hospitalized for the chemo So when you say to me hey Doc how am I gonna am I gonna do okay on this chemo I go I think you are because I looked at the factors that I'm worried about and you're okay I think you're going to do great or okay I looked at the factors and um now you're just scaring the heck out of me so we're not doing it but that is a decision made together double or triple now moving on we're now moving to the green boxes on our journey so now\n these are all the resistance like okay we've done all this and now you see the difference immediately which is we just talked about a double and a triple coming in all the studies that we've done in this green box space have had no lead in just I had an injection so now everybody's asking everyone okay well um if I just came in and said oh shoot you know this I think my cancer got electricity in the car now what do I do and then I go okay well that's great because we're just going to move on to\n this algorithm when in real life you go oh you know what we were sort of treating that already over here when you were in the blue box what are we going to do about the green box and now we're all shaking our heads like uh oh now it got complicated where it's not complicated is is chemotherapy in the mix yes if you didn't get a triple chemotherapy is still something you should do if you're in the green box where the hormones don't work anymore you have two of them this was already in that big list\n right so just to reset everyone's uh memory but where's the new stuff I've had chemo I've had all the hormones I'm just gonna stare at you until you tell me what the new stuff is and you know what the new stuff is the stuff that only three of you raised your hands which are parp inhibitors so you have an entire new class of drugs that nobody's heard of and it's now all the discussion points where now you know our last meeting you had medical oncologists sort of go at it you know listen we're a bunch of nerds\n you know forever for us to get into a fisticuff it's gonna take a lot but the verbal fisticuffs are out there because everyone's like well is my patient going to get this should we do that we're a little confused ourselves I'm not confused it's all just having a strategy so you guys in your journey you need a strategy so what's new what's new is we figured out how to leverage what we know when your DNA doesn't work so great the chemo that I was just talking about bus up your dma\n DNA and all your good cells and your bad cells die right that's why many of you say Buddha chemo but there are targeted drugs that say well okay well let's back up a second sorry it's the only bio 101 lecture we're going to have right now this one slide if your cancer cells or your normal cells replicate meaning there's one of me there's two of me there's eight of me how does it work to repair itself in case something goes Haywire on the left are all the hits right there DNA is a double strand meaning there's\n two strands to kind of get the messaging across if one of those strands break there is a pathway that's ingrained in that cell to fix itself if you have a DNA double strand break there's a whole nother pathway oh that looks familiar what is that bracha one and two now who's heard about the breast cancer Gene one and two raise your hand okay and most of that is because you either have a female family member in your community or your immediate family that's had breast cancer ovarian cancer and he or sorry she has basically said\n oh I did some testing and I'm bracha 1 or brakatu or Angelina Jolie who has bracha 2 mutation which means that there is a problem in repairing the cell now do I want my cancer cells to repair no I do not I wish I just would and die that's the goal so we get that and we get that this Gene this bracha one and two completely has changed how we think about prostate cancer and just right off the bat how many of you are familiar that having this gene or genetic abnormality sets you up to have prostate cancer raise your hand\n not enough it should be everyone in this room to recognize that that is a missed opportunity that not just affects your generation and yourself but your children and their children and their children so this is the one other thing action number three that you must understand from today that this Gene and its family members have made themselves a nuisance and a target for us to try to do something about in prostate cancer so what do we do in terms of treatment I'm going to run through just a few slides that will look overwhelming but I'll\n tell you I'm running it because I'll tell you that in our world as the Physicians we haven't come to a consensus so the first thing is we actually have an FDA approved drug which is known as a laparib for those of you who have family members who are women with breast ovarian cancer they may already be on this drug or pancreatic cancer that's a shocker for a lot of people maybe on this drug it's also approved for prostate cancer there's the indication right there as of May of 2020 when we are deep in our\n pandemic this was lost in messaging completely lost who heard a bit anyone nope no giant Splash like luteum right everyone heard this thing got approved and it was everywhere so it's approved for those who have this abnormality and who has had one of those hormone pills okay so where is that now should we combine things now we're in the combo phase everybody's like well one of these is good shouldn't two of them be better you just told me a triplet is good a doublet is good sure sure here's a study\n so the study results are the following if you combine these two it really works in everyone just this alone this statement generated so much controversy not because we don't believe the data it's just we don't think it's intuitively something that makes sense it's like if you have a DNA thing like oh I have this problem I have a drug for this problem shouldn't it only work in that group now you're telling me it should be everyone who walks in I should just get a double so I could tell you that right now the\n matter isn't subtle but us not being settled doesn't mean you should be unsettled it means you should ask should I get two of these of course nothing in oncology is straightforward here's a similar study using a different combo and it only worked in the people who had the mutation oh man okay let's not let's not get too worried because now there's another study because you know we like to do many at the same time and this combination with enzolutamide did work in everyone so you got the first one which is good\n in everyone you got the second one only in those who have genetic abnormalities and you have the third one which is good in everyone yep thanks for catching up that's where we all are right now and now we have a second drug that again I know you missed the uh the announcement because this is May of 2020 when we're all hunkered down during coven this is another pill that's got uh you know FDA approval and those with the genetic abnormality I'm sure most of you have never heard about this but it's FDA approved and now\n this study was done which showed that hey after you've had a bunch of doublets you can move straight to this if you have the abnormality wait wait what what right right if I've had a bunch of doublets when I was a blue box and now I turn into a green box resistant I can go on this if I have an abnormality but shouldn't I go on the another doublet right your entry point was totally different and that's why we're all still squawking to one another and haven't resolved it what's it mean for\n you guys as patients it means ask if the drug is even something you should be treated with let us worry about this kind of minutia this is when all the nerds in the room has nothing to do with you guys you just need to ask is this drug ready now are you gonna know you have this if you don't check yourself no so who has had any type of genetic testing to even know what kind of genes don't work right in their system should be everyone in this room it is now standard of care let me show you a free registry called Promise cancer or sorry\n prostate cancer promise where you can get this for free they ship you a kit if you're worried about insurance coverage and so on it's a saliva based test they send you the kit you get the answer back everyone should know their status because if you have this you could pass it on to the next generation so I'm going to put that up there for a minute prostate cancer promise it's free it is United States wide and they will ship to you anywhere these are the other flags let's say you don't know\n look what made it to the bottom metastatic prostate cancer all the stuff we're talking about right now by our national guidelines if you have that you should know your your status if you're sitting here anywhere at a stage four at the bare minimum you need to have testing that is question and action number four if you have not gotten tested you need to ask if it's appropriate to get tested because why you might also find other abnormalities of nothing to do with a breast cancer Gene so the other testing we do on your\n actual cancer are things that might get you immunotherapy so immunotherapy is a whole different class it's made the news for lung cancer and melanoma and kidney cancer and bladder cancer but prostate cancer not so much the only time is if you have this particular status that shows up on your testing and let me tell you I have one recently and his PSA was three thousand I gave this medicine it went down to two boom because he had this if you have the target we have a drug just want to make sure now does it work\n in everything with immunotherapy okay not such great news you've now got a whole bunch of combos with immunotherapies that don't work so is that important for you guys to know yes because the newer way to think about this and it's not to also forget about simple loosal tea as the first immunotherapy the new generation of ways to think about novel things is car T now who's heard about car T treatment usually in Leukemia and Lymphoma and multiple myeloma the liquid tumors in prostate cancer this is an Avenue of\n getting a T Cell directed treatment that is specific to you to really try to kill the cancer I'm also going to mention another directive is psma but you will have an in-depth discussion about psma twofold action item number five I promise you we won't exceed five today one Imaging is this appropriate for you to find your cancer and to treatment so these are the two types of Imaging and your doctors will know and this is what it shows this is actually my patient the left is a bone scan you know doesn't look great with all the dark\n spots but you could see the middle and the right side is the psma look at that middle all those dots and your skeleton is cancer and this gentleman's PSA was four thousand so the Imaging how you look at something will matter I know you're going to have a great discussion about this but it's also really helpful if you have a teeny itty bitty part too you don't have to have widespread disease you can also just say why is my PSA of 1.\n 8 it's driving me crazy uh you know I had surgery I don't understand go look here's an example see the giant arrow with the the lighted part on the right that is a lymph node hanging out there you treat the lymph node your PSA might go away that is another way to think about Advanced cancer and targeted treatment and there are many trials so the current indication is if you had one of those pills if you've had a chemo so there are trials this one's closed but there are trials around you that might be available\n lastly you have radium so what we were talking about with Marie Curie this is still an appropriate treatment for men who only have the cancer in the bones and you're hurting if you're that with no liver or lung this is still an FDA approved makes you feel better longer survival treatment we've gotten away from this this is on this is on the you know the list everyone's forgotten because a shiny new object showed up don't forget that's why I keep the list really comprehensive because you can\n always go back and go what about that and then I go oh yeah we just never talked about it it's not a matter of talking about it's knowing there are 983 Interventional trials available that is open and accruing throughout the U.S if you go on clinicaltrials.gov all you got to put in is prostate cancer and whatever stage but that is a whole lot of trials for you to participate in you don't have any advancements that we talked about today without going on a study because that style of the world Works to develop\n drugs so car T is the rage but you have to be the appropriate patient think about what we talked about the fitness of the patient bromodomain Inhibitors is another sort of agent that's now really starting to take off Androgen receptor degraders let's get rid of the cars not just take away their gas that is one out of maybe a thousand targets that we work with at crematis we have a hundred prostate trials that are always open because I serve such a diverse group of patients there's if I don't have it I share with\n the University of Michigan and Henry Ford and so many others around me it is critical but do this for yourself today figure out who's on your team to make this happen because if I wanted radium I need a nuclear medicine or radiation oncology doctor if I wanted lutition the same if I wanted chemo I need a medical oncologist if I'm still having problems with my prostate I need a urologist if I have trouble with my nutrition and diet I need one of those experts on my team this is just the list figure out\n who's around you I would encourage you guys to actually make this write this you see your doctor say that's my team this is my team that helps me get from point A to point B you're now part of my team not should I keep this doctor because now I'm seeing you nah everybody's on the team and this is going to be growing as we have better and newer drugs that come through is my last slide lots of options if you are sitting in the audience whether virtual or here with a stage four lots of options do not\n despair just ask if your doctor doesn't have something for you asked to be referred to an Institute that has maybe different options nothing can be lost with another opinion that's one two understand how we think so that we can better help you think the way you know to approach this so it's a journey figure out which in a way which box are you and sometimes you can just take what I wrote up there and say Doc where am I in this journey here because I got lost sometimes we get lost I've had patients\n in my practice my I'm there 20 years have a patient I've treated with stage four for 15 years we're definitely lost except he knows he's way over here on the green box he just waits for the next trial to open so figure out where you are and if you have not gotten tested whether it's looking at an inherited panel at minimum or if your spread disease with what we call a just a cancer-centric panel get tested ask about it if you don't know go on that registry it's free for everyone and please try to think about enrolling\n in a clinical trial thank you so much for your attention today everyone thank you that was awesome I'm not just saying that because you're from Michigan honestly people we were talking how good is that in terms of being comprehensive was that helpful you guys absolutely she's my let's see I'm trying to make this you're my Dr souls in Michigan right I mean thank you yeah it's that and I hope you come back soon because I know you have to go today so let me give you a quick update to the audience go to\n slide five please her Slide Five that's my I love that it's like I love I love this slide this is like uh this is like a game show it's like you know it's like picking all right can we talk about before we go into this slide no I'll talk about this slide right away here's the controversy yeah um luticium so here's our newest approval last year we're jumping up and down we're like this is unbelievable we're gonna get this and it works it works and now will you tell them the\n story um I'm trying not to and then just tell them what we should do with that story does anybody know that there's a story let's start there or is he just talking about what he's worried about raise your hands if you know there's a story so right there see Dr moyan a lot of people don't know there's a story there's a big story and so I want you to tell them yeah so so anytime we get one of these drugs the first question is okay great thanks for doing the study okay the second is when can I get it\n right so pills you go to your Specialty Pharmacy it might take a week or a month but usually these companies know like you get an approval everyone wants it so let's go so it's just again back to cars because I'm from Motor City you know you get a new car oh I want to get out there and start test driving so Leticia 77 177 has been you know really on the cusp for years so this has been a topic for advocacy this has been a topic for patients and imaging and so on so we finally got it approved and they had one of what I would say an\n extremely Rocky start because somewhere along the way who's ever figuring out supply and demand didn't get it correct so if many of us in the room know that we have an Imaging and it's you're lit up like my patient and you want the drug I as your doctor should be able to refer to our radiation doctor so that he or she could prescribe the drug and we're on our way and because everyone is doing that there's no Supply and the no Supply is not just U.\n S but worldwide so the second hiccup is just communication so what are we doing today we're communicating with one another talking to one another sharing the communication from unfortunately the company has been quite sparse so we are kind of talking amongst ourselves almost like okay I've got five slots what do you got over there in Grand Rapids and what do you got over there in Ann Arbor and we're kind of trying to negotiate and what we found out recently is anybody who wants to start today cannot there is not enough Supply the only\n Supply that is available is if Dr moyad is started a patient and there's six treatments you have to commit to the full six treatment for the person who started that means if you are a patient who's eligible for it today you cannot get it now if you just heard me talk today and we're excited that there are options how is it that one of the biggest options that's available is really not available it's really unacceptable and so at this moment we are extremely worried have had ad nauseam conversations\n with the company which is Novartis and this is not a mystery I know those of you who may know Novartis they do great work it's just the planning of it was so incredibly poor between the lack of access not enough they actually are building two new centers two new centers who's done building anything you build a house it's going to take a long time these are nuclear-grade isotopes you're not going to just do this and stock up a bunch of pills this is real challenge now becomes not just an access issue but\n now we have disparity in prostate cancer we just talked about of which groups are not getting the best treatment who's got the highest mortality and now we don't even have access for those who are in underserved communities like the one I serve in Detroit so the levels of just unacceptability is just keeps growing and that's where we are so we don't expect to see this drug administered for many more months so people who qualify for this drug need to talk about all these other options ASAP correct so why\n this is important is I never focus on what I don't have so you've been educated now you know but what else do we have so I gave you how many trials are available there's the Box many of you don't even know the drugs on the box I mentioned ask that of your doctor so there are alternatives don't get hung up on this is what I want and I can't get it we'll be stuck there a long time my estimation is six to nine if not my realistic estimation is one year clinical trials here is what I would say to you you've\n got almost a thousand clinical trials so if I'm a skeptic I'm saying I don't want to get stuck in some trial where someone's experimenting with me and we don't have any data or if I get a placebo what's the point yeah so can you just answer I know you're excited about clinical trials how do I get excited about clinical trials or get excited about finding a trial that works for me since there's a thousand yeah two things one you have to make sure you're eligible for the trial so although\n there's a lot for where you are right now there may be only a handful and it may not even be in your neighborhood so you got to even figure out what's the question number two most trials especially if you're in the green box no placebo that is unethical you had spread disease that's not ethical to have Placebo number three every single drug well that was on the screen was on a trial at one point so you don't know if it's going to work until you finish the trial so there is a sense of altruism that you have to have\n this is going to help the next guy so that's a lot of it with trials yeah and and do you find that if I go into a trial the trials you're working with do you find that if some if we see something working can I cross over can I are you can you explain that yeah so a lot of Trials are built like Ford makes great trucks I'm going down this way and Chevy makes great trucks I'm going down this way if at some point we find out don't kill me anyone from the car company Chevy makes better Trucks Than Ford then the question is\n well should then everyone get the Chevy truck some trials do that and some do not but your recourses okay well I'm not staying on the trial get me off that trial and buy my own Chevy truck so you don't sit there getting told what to do you actively participate at any point you're not comfortable we say stop any point you don't feel good you say stop time out trials are there to help you it's not to tell you what to do is there to help you beat your disease I want to talk about bone drugs yes\n so a paper came out a few months ago in Jama it said it said men on hormone therapy according to this database less than 10 percent of them get screened for osteoporosis and if they get screened and they go on a bone drug if they need it it reduces the risk of fracture and I looked at this paper which I have and it said less than 10 percent of the men on hormone therapy are being screened for osteoporosis is that true that is true so what do we do well let me ask you how do you screen for osteoporosis anybody\n know is it a questionnaire yes sir who's ever heard of a dexa scan okay should be all of you guys in this room so women know because we get screen frostoprosis all the time you know as we age as women we lose bone strength with men because you're now in a forced menopause State as we were talking about it's really important to know your bone density now I have to tell you Medicare will usually only cover it every two years but either your primary care can do the screening which is perfectly fine\n or your urologist or your oncologist if you're on any type of hormone drug injectables orals you need this test done because we can take one of those either one in the green box to help strengthen because what's the worst thing that will happen fracture and when you get a fracture it hurts and it limits your lifestyle so let's not get a fracture now that's again you always talk about vitamin D and calcium and all those nutrients and you know some exercise as well to help strengthen yeah but it's the same thing we have\n studies to show these two FDA approved drugs help yeah but it's not being administered so what can you guys do advocate for yourself and ask hey is this something important now the other part that somebody will bring up because this always happens in conversation is well I don't want this thing to happen to my mouth so it is a very small percent of people have what they call o-n-j and that stands for osteonecrosis of the jaw which sounds horrible because it can be horrible if not managed and our dentists really don't\n like this drug but they'd rather know that you're on it so they can follow along with you on your dental exams then you not being on it at all and all it means is just the gums kind of erode so you get to see the bone the fix stop giving the medication and it should be fixed so it's empowering yourself to know that is a very small side effect but something you should know about great now yeah people ask me that they asked me to do a lecture on deficiency of vitamin D and the title my lecture was there's not a deficiency in vitamin\n D there's a deficiency in dexa I just thought that would be a cute thing to get people to remember to go get their dexes done yeah that has virtually no radiation and it's safe and that's how women get diagnosed with osteoporosis too yeah okay can we talk about genetics now yeah um so here's the two genetic drugs you talk about the laparib or cap rib right here yep so are you saying that anybody okay there's my opinion and I want to know where it's going are you saying that anyone diagnosed with prostate\n cancer today in the audience should know should have this genetic test done the brca test yes so let's talk about the test okay there's two types of ways we think about genetic testing there's the what you got from your mom and your dad that makes you you so that is your original blueprint you had nothing to do with it except that's just you so that is what we call an inherited panel now there are a thousand companies doing these kinds of testing most of us know that bracha 1 or brca1 and two have\n a family of about 10 other cousins so people get confused they're like but I had my braca one and two tests done but what you really want is a more comprehensive panel because you want to catch all 10 other family members all the cousins so what's like a cousin pal B2 so literally p-a-l-b-2 cdk-12 these are genes most people in this audience have never heard of but if you have one of those cousins be positive you can also get the the treatment and the Red Box so everybody's like well I don't have\n the braca I have rad 51 okay you're eligible so that's confusing right you're like wait wait wait wait you just told me it's a bracket right because we put the bucket of inherited genes as only bracha one and two that's one the second piece is you don't have that so you're going to say well how many people have that so in what you get for Mom and Dad it's about 10 percent okay so that means 90 your blueprint doesn't have anything that you have to worry about but for the ten percent of\n you that have this you're going to pass it on to the next Generation potentially and then they may pass it on to their children so if one thing you do right which is check yourself if you've got medicine prostate cancer or high risk prostate cancer then you know whether you pass it on or not and there are genetic counselors as you can see on my team I have genetic counselors because it's not up to you to explain it so I had a patient say to me I don't want to get the test because I don't know what that\n means for my family and I literally have like 12 grandchildren I go that's not up to you you will have a professional help guide you to figure out what do you do next in terms of talking and families come in all shapes and sizes so these are again for blood relatives so you might have you know step children and Blended families these are going to be for blood um you know generation now your cancer does things all on its own so cancer itself meaning it's not something I'm passing on but now my prostate cancer let's say in the liver\n is getting tested I can blueprint that today how sometimes we take a sample so sometimes your doctor's like I'm going to take a sample of your liver and then I'm going to send it for blueprinting I could tell you that sometimes it's 18 to 20 percent of the time that cancer has something in this family 20 you guys 20 that's a high number for people to be able to directly get those agents in the red box so 10 that gets passed down 20 percent that's only in the cancer so most of my patients have it in their\n cancer only and not in their original blueprint so their kids and grandkids are fine but they themselves we have a different path forward because now we know his particular cancer there are some of you who say well I don't want to undergo a biopsy you know the needle is that I don't want to do it they now can do liquid so you take tubes of blood and we can then check that now that is a super complicated lecture will take us a week to go through but there are whole companies and we partner with many of them you literally take two\n tubes and they check the DNA from these cancer cells floating around from your original prostate to the lymph nodes to the liver and whatever shed around in the bloodstream we can capture that on the blood test guess what that's blueprinted too so we call that liquid biopsy so tissue biopsy is only for the person liquid biopsy is only for the person and then blood testing or saliva is to know your original blueprint does that help that makes sense I I can tell you stories of primary care doctors and hear\n other places they said what's Liquid biopsy I called any random Company the company called them they were offering it themselves you know within Weeks Later the prostate patients so you think that everybody should at least have that discussion about getting that genetic panel done and that makes me happy because I just cannot believe how underutilized those tests are and and it's also your inherited is a one-time yeah so if your doctor did it five years ago that's the same you're still you from Mom and Dad forever you only need\n that once the stuff in your cancer if you're in the green box can change so how you were two years ago is not how you are now we these cancers like to you know kind of pick up a lot more genetic mutations that's how they get worse that's how they know how to escape a bunch of routes so you can get repeat testing on those and and the results you see with those specific drugs the people who are brca positive have you seen like really robust responses with these new drugs I would say the number one sort of leader in\n that family is the brca2 okay so those are the folks I see the most response and I mean like oh three thousand to ten that kind of thing yeah yeah the other family members are so-so so the one that's getting a lot of traction in our field is ATM really tough because we're not sure if that should be a family member that's you know we don't know if that's a slacker in the family and just sort of like hey I'm here but they don't really you know there's no real activity but that's the chatter on the science\n end so you hear well my doctor said he was talking to another doctor and then she said this don't worry about that so that's on us that sometimes we almost think out loud too much and then you guys get stuck into that conversation and you know when people talk they talk and then you're like so at the end of the day was that mean you can say that as patients you can say that's great I'm glad you guys all had a blah blah blah but what's it mean for me right now so if I had a patient with that mutation\n until there's really new data that says no yeah I would offer it because you know what it's like anything else in our world we give it for a little bit it doesn't work you're gonna know yeah you're gonna know it's not like you're signing up for two years you're going to know by the time you check the next PSA great um before I ask you last few philosophical questions we're going to talk two more topics the first one is chemotherapy chemotherapy is really strange to me because there's perception\n and reality can you tell me who qualifies for chemotherapy maybe you want to throw in your opinion of why it still just gets such negative perception in the field when I don't think people realize its use as expanded and it's actually doing more good in a lot of places but I don't want tell me your thoughts on who gets chemotherapy and how to look at it from a more positive standpoint let me just take a quick poll who Associates chemotherapy with something bad I used to okay now I get the whole room to raise\n their hand finally towards the end you all raise your hand because whether it's media betrayal or their family experience you know whether you are a bone marrow transplant chemo person stuck in the hospital for three months or watching a movie from the 1990s where somebody's throwing up their guts you know into a bowl to just that that narrative has never changed what got better we have better drugs to control nausea vomiting the chemotherapy associated with prostate cancer is on the end of the spectrum where nausea and vomiting is\n not even in the in the scale so we use drugs like cisplatin for other cancers Platinum drugs those are the hard ones but even those we can control very well with drugs so as chemotherapy matured all the supportive medicines along with chemotherapy got better too is it active 100 it is to me a missed opportunity if you do not get chemotherapy I'm not saying you can't push it off that you can't delay absolutely you can do all that but at some point when it's go time and this is what I say in my patients when it's go\n time it's go time it's literally once every three weeks for one hour aren't you surprised when I say that everybody has like wait a minute it's going to be weekly and I'm going to get all sorts now bits one lousy one hour infusion of one drug every three weeks that's it it is active don't put it away until you know you're not a candidate so who's not a candidate yeah okay you saw my scale see how it's not a mystery so if you're kind of more frail or you're like uh oh\n I've got all these other things going on that maybe has nothing to do with my cancer people with really bad diabetes have neuropathy this drug can make it worse but in general most people are candidates but do you have to wait for many courses to see if there's a response are you seeing is it after one or two courses or cycles that you could you can see whether or not it's really taking I mean how do you approach that with patients I think it's usually you give three of these so in about nine weeks you know\n okay yep but guess what you almost know after the first one not because of the numbers but because you'll feel better because uncontrolled cancer makes you feel terrible no appetite no energy I feel lousy even if you're getting chemo and your cancer is controlled you will feel better people are often shocked that they actually feel better on chemo well because you're killing your cancer so you're controlled are you telling me Dr Heath that my quality of life improves on chemo if I'm getting a response yes\n that's where I used to not like it and you realize it that's true right it is it's it's the perception and reality and prostate is painful okay thank you because I haven't had I've never talked to you about that yeah immune therapy okay it's not just the coved stuff going on the MRNA stuff there's the modern has got stuff going on in cancer we've had Provence yep so can you make a comment on Provence that uh a lot of people could qualify for now and then tell me about these new special\n immuno drugs immunotherapy drugs and how I would get one for me okay so the purple sippolusal tea is FDA approved it's been approved since 2010 that's you getting uh treatment that the cells that we take out of you gets rejiggered and excited and taught to see the cancer gets reinfused complicated right you think vaccine should be an injection and I'm done but there's a process to that medicine what do we know for the right person it works and who's that right person those with minimal metastatic cancer kind of like\n right in the beginning of your green box Journey oh my PSA is six I've got a few spots I feel great I'm still coaching Little League like what's the problem no pain that's the right group and if you're African-American that's the group that has done the best now I got to tell you we've talked about disparities how you know the numbers are worse for the black men in our community with prostate cancer that's the one drug where it's actually better in that particular group never seen before so I see a lot of men\n who are African-American in the Detroit community that is on my list of medicines to offer but it's not for everyone it's not for the person with uncontrolled cancer of 3000 PSA and feels lousy not that pet scan you saw that means it's already too far away now the next in line is everything else the pembraluzumab which is keytruda the nivolumab which is opdivo these are things on commercials you see it for lung cancer and so on doesn't really have any role in prostate cancer right now and all those trials they were a\n bust they added nothing to you just being on a pill so that we know five years ago we didn't know now we know car T is very very specialized so the hyped up sort of Next Generation version is how do I get my tea immune cells to go find the cancer cartee is really only for very specific few Cartier you have to get chemo like you're about to get bone marrow transplant big doses of chemo to almost wipe out so what are I have patients undergoing car T in Detroit what I say is it's like we know when your computer is so messed up and it\n doesn't matter how many times you try to fix it sometimes all you got to do is go to the wall and go wait 30 seconds that's what you do for car T so we wipe out your bone marrow with big doses of chemo get the Slate clean and when your cells come back then we reinfuse the rejigger T cells and that's how we that is the most aggressive way that we can think about immunotherapy for prostate cancer but think about it for you to get that level of chemo you know we really need to be fit not have a huge heart\n condition you're in the hospital for several weeks really intense and what's the biggest breakthrough you think is coming in down the pipe and I say in my world because there's so much cancer in our family down the pipeline means in the next 12 months or six months like what what what what area is getting you so excited there could be a breakthrough that we have to be watching and this is not a stock tip this is the same I dealt with my family we were always looking at trials what are you excited about I think the next\n wave is not really immunotherapy or targeted agents and so on I think it's actually in the world of theranostics so the psma is one target but that world has a gazillion targets and it's this idea if I can see it I can design a drug and then you can treat it so there are many so if you look at all the companies out there it's not just psma yeah and also for the record it is in prostate patients but psma is expressed in all sorts of other cancers not to derail the crowd but that is a head scratcher I thought it's only\n a prostate nope it's in a whole lot of other cancers but there are targets that can be imaged that then you can design a drug a payload you come in and kill it that's truly personalized medicine I hope we get there wow I mean that's that's that's quite a plug for our next speaker I didn't even know you were going to say that all right don't leave I got her a gift so can he last question ready ready and then I give you a gift so what you don't know is that we we work on a we're on a couple boards to\n try to get free health care to men you know we do that big thing the screenings of this at the uh Lions stadium thousands of men get free uh screenings and so we're involved in a lot of volunteering and then so a number of people we work with get Governors Awards like the highest award and so one of our colleagues got one recognized by our governor this year for outstanding service and I'm reading the list of people who won Governor's award and once said Catherine Heath and I'm like who what can you tell me who Catherine Heath\n is we've got a governor award how old she is oh boy yeah so that's my youngest daughter um she's actually a junior at Duke University uh go Blue Devils but she is a really yeah stem Die Hard even though her major is in public policy when she was a high schooler volunteering in Detroit she said you know you have a problem here Mom I said you know that's never good for a dinner conversation she said I have options to go into the clinic and meet all these people and help where are my peers so she created a\n program called Focus stem NextGen visit the website it is really a way to engage our high schoolers to be excited about science and health care and we've done everything from in-person programming that she made us do because we all work for Katie and moving into the virtual space because of the pandemic and now we're actually on the metaverse so creating programs and really encouragement for those in Detroit which most of those schools are 90 percent you know free or subsidized lunch so a really compromised group and my daughter\n was sort of and still continues to spearhead this so that everyone gets access to that type of awareness this early so she got recognized by our governor so it says a lot and uh thank you and so now she's destined become a prostate cancer oncologist you're right that's the president so I leave you with this but we're going to send it I'm not going to take on the plane because it might break right you and I are Out of Towners we don't know this Hollywood thing I just come in here twice a year\n and wow and I thought what's appropriate to give Dr Keith for her first visit here because this is another way of making sure you show up again in a year or two for the big conference and I thought let's give her an Oscar so oh wow it says Elizabeth Heath Oscar for best oncologist ever pcri there you go seriously thank you guys thank you so we just gotta we got an escort Dr Heath so otherwise Delta Airlines is going to be upset with me all right let's go thank you so much everyone all right I just really you know I just really\n wanted this to make it happen one day there's a guy in the audience named Dan Epstein uh Mr USC he's been a part of this thing since day one he's been in great to the organization and we put this all together I'm telling you this is a really special moment to see 10 celebrities I think it's a total of ten come together for this conference and they're they're very loud they talk in a loud manner they're just very loud so if it's too loud for you you can always cover your ears a little bit but\n this is going to be a great moment so if the celebrities are here for their 10 minute to say hello can we get them to come out thank you ladies and gentlemen the USC Marching Band foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music]\n [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you so much I really appreciate it I mean I can't tell you how much went behind the scenes and with Jeff and to get the team here and they have so many events so we have to sneak it in during the time that the celebrities were free\n and to me when I come out to LA you know coming from Michigan the marching band there I mean these are the celebrities I mean they're they're incredible talent I I appreciate you very much thank you very much absolutely let me just say a quick word of things too I was in the USC Marching Band at one time and I played trumpet not like this gentleman here but but it's uh it's just harkenspects such great memories thank you so much Mark never tells me what's going to happen so this is a total surprise to me and uh so\n you guys are awesome thank you thank you thank you [Music] thank you Dr Heath and thank you Dr moyad before we move on I do want to thank our sponsors bear my event Pfizer estellas and dendrion for helping us put on this conference it's thanks to them that were able to make it free for all of you also please if you would like to donate pcri is a 501c3 non-profit and you can donate at pcri.\n org forward slash donate and that helps us keep this cause going and keeps our conferences free in all these videos on our YouTube channel now we're going to go into psma Imaging for prostate cancer and we're going to talk about pluvicto or luticium which is a big Topic in prostate cancer right now and we have an expert in this field discussing this topic his name is Dr Johannes chernin and he is the chief of the amundsen translational theragnostics division for UCLA he's an incredible speaker because he breaks down what psma\n is and he's also able to tell us updates and what's going on with pluvecto and Dr moyad and him to had a great discussion on this I'm sure you're going to find it informative so without further Ado thank you Dr Honis for joining us at our 2023 conference thank you very much it's uh it's a great honor for me to do this I think very often we can learn much more from the patients than the patients can learn from us because you know the disease much better I'm an Imaging person but I was trained in medicine\n and now we of course branching out from just Imaging to also therapies so I'm actually going to talk about both the diagnostic part and the therapeutic part because I think many of you have read about blue Victor and the treatment of prostate cancer that we can do with radioactive psma targeted substances these are my conflict of interest disclosures so this is the overview of what I'm going to talk about the first one is talk about a little bit what what is PET CT what is best imaged with MRI ultrasound\n Pet City in prostate cancer bone scans what is psma which I think is important for you to to know and then I talk about the diagnostic Story how did this Imaging essay this tool come about becomes so successful and so important in helping patients with prostate cancer and then the psma therapeutic story we have treated more than 250 patients with psma targeted what is called radio ligand therapy then of course I want to talk quite a bit about frequently asked questions and I hope many questions will come up in\n the end but what the process is how is it done what's the effectiveness what's the safety what are the side effects and so on and then talk about challenges and there are of course challenges with the rollout of these new treatments and I want to address some of these concerns and and problems so what is Pet City Pet City consists of a CT scanner cat scanner and a pet scanner in one machine and you can acquire simultaneously the anatomy of the body and you can look at metabolism or expression of some targets\n such as psma which stands for prostate specific membrane antigen we inject the radioactive tracer that is a very low radiation dose that we give to the patients perfectly safe and then we get these images that showing CAT scan a pet scan and refuse the images so that you have a combination of the anatomy and what we call function sometimes or molecular information with PET Imaging you can look at various aspects of the disease here shows some examples of different pet traces that have been injected into patients and they will give you\n different information you probably have heard about the exumen scan this is something that was approved before the psma scan by the FDA and it allows you to image amino acid utilization of prostate cancer how much amino acids does the prostate cancer eat and where does it where does the consumption occur where in the body then you see the psma scan as the second one here many patients have had fdg PET CT skins that's glucose metabolism so we can look at glucose metabolism we also can look at lipid metabolism\n that is important how much fat does the the cancer consume and we can look at calcium metabolism that's the bone scan each of these scans gives you different information and the ones that are now really used in prostate cancer this one axumen and then psma and then to a certain degree of course Still Still the bone scan what is MRI used for MRI is really used mostly for detecting the site of the prostate cancer in the prostate it will also give you some information of regional lymph nodes and they can also be used to look\n at distant disease in a targeted way but that's the most important indication of MRI is really looking for diagnosis and localizing the prostate cancer and the ultrasound is used to guide the biopsy so you insert the transducer and then you have a needle attached to it and then you conduct you do the biopsy and it's a targeted biopsy based on what you see on the ultrasound so that you don't get randomly into the prostate and now a little bit about this term theranostics you have probably heard about\n thernostics the term gives it away it's a combination of therapeutic Terror and diagnostic Arctic so you have a therapeutic component and the diagnostic component and the interesting part is you can label or mark an isotope with a diagnostic or a therapeutic isotope and this is shown in this diagram here where you have therapeutic Isotopes labeling one molecule but you can do the same with the diagnostic Isotopes you can get pet images and you can treat the patient and you can Target it to some structure that is sitting on the\n prostate cancer cells it's like a smart weapon that seeks out the cancer by looking at this certain structure that is expressed by the by the cancer a diagram or example of what a prostate cancer cell looks like and that has on top of its seedling psma in this case prostate specific membrane antigen and then you have a molecule that is labeled with the diagnostic isotope for Pet Imaging and then you have the same molecule labeled with the therapeutic isotope in this case lutitium 177 and then this compound finds the\n prostate cancer cell in the body after it is injected into a vein and then it gives you this image and what you see in red here is thresholded out prostate cancer metastasis so then you can see where the disease is and you can treat with the therapeutic compound and sometimes get these spectacular results this is not a fake image this is a True Image this is the disease before the treatment this is near complete absence of disease after treatment with the radioactive compound so you have one molecule to see the same\n molecule to treat just by labeling with a different kind of an isotope and this is how it is done in a very simplified way it's a simple injection into a vein and we talked later about you know what the side effects are what the process is and how this works this is not new this is actually a tote from a article and that was published in 1949 in Life Magazine this is a patient with thyroid cancer and you see the patient before the treatment with radioactive iodine and after now we do this all the time in the\n clinic we can take an image of the thyroid and look uh with radioactive iodine and we see the extent of the disease and then we give a different iodine isotope and we have the patient swallow that and then it will treat it and the outcomes are really often like this you see the patient in very very Dire Straits here and then completely recovered years after the after the treatment that was the kind of the first diagnostic approach the first really targeted radiation approach that was used successfully in patients\n yeah I'm not going to talk too much about the biology of this because it's kind of interesting this was found in the process-specific membrane antigen psma was discovered already in the 1980s and the function is still not very well known but what we do know is that it is associated with promoting tumor growth and tumor aggressiveness so it is something that where you have a lot in the body that lights up on the scans that it denotes that you have to do something about it because the tumor is more aggressive the story actually with psma\n targeted therapy and and Diagnostics started in Europe I would say maybe 10 years ago or so when a compound that actually was developed in the United States by a guy called Marty Pompa was rediscovered in Germany was modified and then given to patients to diagnose prostate cancer and to start treating prostate cancer with the substances that I showed you in the U.\n S things are different we need to go through a very orderly approval process we have to go to the FDA we need to do all the prospective studies that was not the case in Europe they simply said fundamentally this is safe so we can try it and that set the stage later on for a huge wave of centers opening up in Europe Asia Australia where people could already get the scan and get the therapy the psma targeted therapy and people from all over the world would go there to get this treatment this is shown one example how this was dealt with in and promoted in Europe\n this is from the University of Essen in Germany and the physician is a person who actually came from Germany to teach us everything about psma several years ago I want to show you now some of the studies that led to the FDA approval because these are studies that UCSF Tom hope and we did together and I think that's maybe one of the more important things that I did in my professional life so that I want to show you some some of the data that we that kind of justify the success of psma targeted Imaging the first study was\n done in patients who with the intermediate or high risk prostate cancer who [Music] who were scheduled to undergo surgery and had every test before that they had bone scans they had a CAT scan and were qualified the surgical candidates and in these patients we then did the psma scan the idea was the patient saying go to surgery and to find out whether what we see on the scans is really correct by histology so these patients had essentially everything and then when they went to surgery the surgeons found disease additional\n disease which we detected with a pretty good chance detected we call it 40 50 chance to detect it with the scan before surgery and that implies that if you do the scan before you have a pretty large number of patients that shouldn't undergo surgery but when the treatment should really be something different now overall about 25 of the patients had disease when we imaged them in those patients no disease was known before we did the outside of the prostate was known before we did the scan there are two compounds now that did a\n very similar study the one gallium psma 11 is used at UCSF and UCLA it's an academic non-commercial uh uh substance the other one is commercially available and it's called dcfpyl and they are very give you very similar image information as shown here here you see where the arrow points to a tiny little lymph node that was detected again a lymph node in a patient with intermediate risk prostate cancer that's something that is really really important to optimize patient management you get exactly the same information\n from both scans so if you ask why don't I have a pyl skin why do I get a psma 11 scan gives you the same diagnostic information we still miss microscopic disease if it's too small then we can't see it and some of the prostate cancer lesions have a low expression they don't have enough of this psma receptors on the cancer cells that I talked about then we can miss disease too so that was one important study that was done and you saw it was done in 277 patients and I also want to mention these studies were only possible because\n patients paid for the scan so there was no mechanism to get this paid for no NIH funding no other funding to do this so we're very grateful for the patients who were willing to pay for these scans this is an example if Imaging before radiation treatment or surgery this was a comparison between bonds and Bone scans and CAT scans in psma scans and the data in the nutshell where that you have higher diagnostic accuracy you see more and it's more accurate with the psma scan it's very well tolerated and it has an enormous\n impact on patient management so the recommendation now actually is to when possible to replace at least the bone skin with the psma PET CT skin because you get all the information on the psma PET CT scan the second important Imaging application is when patients had definitive treatment either surgery or radiation and the PSA starts creeping up PSE starts Rising it's called as you know biochemical recurrence the cancer is somewhere hopefully at a very low level we can detect it and what this graph here shows on the left side is how much\n how often can we detect the side of the recurrence because then you can go after the site either with targeted radiation or with surgery or you in you start systemic treatment or whatever the management of the your oncologist is that is considered most appropriate so here you on the left you see that when the serum PSA the blood PSA is less than 0.\n 5 which is where in the low PS PSA level as you know we already detected about 40 percent of the sites of the recurrent and as the PSA goes up to let's say above two detection rates go up to eight eighty percent or even higher when it's above 5.0 nanogram PS5 we detect almost all of the sites of recurrence again this is important because you cannot dress and treat what you see on the right side you see two examples of this in a patient with a piece of 1.\n 5 after definitive treatment you see the sites of recurrence in lymph nodes these are the little dark spots that you see there and on the right side a PSA of 2.3 where you see on the right groin you see a pelvis you see the sites of recurrence that has a tremendous impact on management and we will not dwell on details here but when you look at the text we looked at the impact of the Imaging on the management of prostate cancer patient and this is done by doing a questionnaire sending a questionnaire before the Pet Scan what would you do\n without the psma scan how would you manage the patient to the Physicians and then two questionnaires after the psma Pet Scan how did your management change and how did your treatment change these were the questions that we asked until here the the answer is written in written out spelled out here the impact on management occurred in change management occurred in more than 50 percent of patients so that's a really really decisive impact on how prostate cancer is now managed when compared to to before so these are the Men in Black so\n we went to the FDA and we got FDA approval after it will show you the tortures pass Pathway to the to this approval but in December of 2020 we got psma approved by the FDA in September of 2021 it was included in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines it's not part of it in November of 2021 it received Medicare coverage as did the psma limb so it's now insurance covered Medicare and most private insurances as you know it's always a fight but we will help with this as often as we can and then this and then uh it's included\n in on in the Society of nuclear amazing guidelines and so on so this is not fully accepted approved reimbursed and recommended so this is the summary on the Imaging portion of the of the uh of this part of the presentation we can assess the extent of the disease after diagnosis and after treatments which is called staging and restaging with a high accuracy and the data are really robust this this was really well done studies there's no ifs and buts it is what it is the numbers are Rock Solid we can identify the source of rising PSA\n this gives the treating urologists neuro-oncologists actionable targets you can really do something about it which is really important information and we have an impact on management now the key question that is still not answered is do we have an impact on outcome do patients live longer do patients live better and that's something where many studies are ongoing we still have to wait for the results and I will show you two examples of the studies that are ongoing him this was a study done at UCLA and just to explain this a little bit this\n is done in patients who had a very low PSA biochemical recurrence and the spots that you see here in the pelvis would be the ones that are targeted by standard radiation in the site of in the at the at the time of rising PSA standard pelvic Salvage radiation treatment but everything that is outside of the pelvis would not be in the radiation field so that would imply that the radiation is not going to be very successful because too many lesions are outside of the standard radiation field and that occurs in about 20 percent of the patients\n so there's a second aspect to this study and that is that we are now collecting we did a random Mass trial where radiation treatment was either based on psma Imaging or not or conventional Imaging and we look at the outcome which we probably have the data within two years to see whether this affects patient survival so I think that's an important study and the other one is this here that we try to improve targeting for surgery radio guided surgery where we inject the radioactive psma ligand for surgery and then the surgeon go in\n and they use a probe to find lymph nodes that have a lot of uptake of this and then can selectively take out these lymph nodes and the idea being that if you do this you will eradicate more of the disease that is in there than if you just go by your standard approaches without knowing whether their metastasis is involved so then there are frequent patients concerns after Imaging one question is am I radioactive and there's a tiny bit of radioactivity but it is orders of magnitude lower when you think compared for instance to external\n beam radiation so there's really no worry about radiation if if you come out of an Imaging study it's not dangerous can it be around children or pregnant women yes you can I eat anything I want before and after the scan yes you can can there be false negative scans where there is disease but we don't find it yes I mentioned that there are small lesions more likely when the blood PSA level is really low don't these lesions you don't that don't produce a lot of psma or it's tiny little lymph nodes that\n just be below the resolution of our scanners can there be false positives something lights up but it's not prostate cancer yes it can happen too it's really rare but it can happen we talked about insurance does insurance cover the scan yes it should we try to work with patients on pre-ordering different position on pre-authorizations if there is a problem but it's in all the guidelines the evidence is there so they should not deny payments for these scans how many PSE Mexicans are performed per year in the United States now it's\n approaching 200 000 per year and the estimate is that it will reach probably a peak of around five six hundred thousand once it's more available throughout the country now I want to talk a little bit about the therapy studies leading to the FDA approval how effective is psma targeted therapy and this is a therapy that is provided and distributed by by Novartis and it has a brand name blue Victor don't know whether that's the best name but that's the name so there were three uh major therapeutically therapeutic\n trials the one was from Australia and what this graphs show when you see the 57 number in the Australian trial that means 57 of patients who were treated with this plutizium psma or plavikto had a drop in their PSA blood piece about 50 percent that was a small study we did a slightly larger study prospective study but also too small at UCLA we had close to 40 response which you call PSA response again a drop of PSA in the blood by 50 percent and then came this large trial on the right which is called division trial\n which led to the approval they found a they looked at outcomes they looked at survival and they found that in patients with metastatic prostate cancer who had every treatment before hormone uh and chemotherapy the survival benefit was more than four months but what is important what you see here is that if patients respond to the treatment then they will live about a year longer than the patients who do not respond so it's always a question you have about 50 40 responders the responders have a significant benefit in terms of of\n survival and then there's the first trial that compared a taxi in chemotherapy that is shown here it's called the therapy trial and in these patients who were either receiving a taxi in chemotherapy or all the pcme targeted radioactive treatment the radioactive treatment was the winner in every aspect and in terms of better tolerated better PSA response and longer progression-free survival the quality of life also is important so then again the FDA approved the psma targeted treatment you see that at the\n bottom here and this is now also in the meantime part of the nccn guidelines Medicare reimbursed and thereby it should be covered by all the different insurance companies So currently we're only allowed to use the treatment in really late stage patients after chemotherapy and there are numerous studies ongoing at any stage of the disease even before surgery as a kind of new adjuvant setting where this radioactive treatment is given to find out but it's actually better and more effective to give the treatment earlier\n and I don't want to mention all these different trials that that are underway but there's a whole bunch of these trials coming and it will probably take several years till we have all the the outcome data here this is what I want to show as the outcomes when the treatment is successful each of these pairs that you see has a pre and the post-treatment scan the red denotes the cancer on the the numbers show the pre-treatment blood PSA levels you can see that they are sometimes very high like 900 something\n and then this is almost completely disappeared these are the so-called super responders that's about 10 percent of the patients so this by no means the standard I just want to show you the best case scenario and now I show you the worst case scenario these are patients who are imaged again late during treatment and you see how the disease progresses while patients are being treated and we must be honest about this we don't know why patients respond or do not respond to the treatment we haven't figured that\n out yet it's it's kind of the key portion of our research that we're doing to try to find out why some patients of 50 of the patients resist this is this is kind of the extreme bad outcome often it's kind of a mix between you know disease stabilization and slow progression so now how is the treatment done and how do we know if it's working and then talk about safety side effects and frequently asked questions so we do a screening procedure at UCLA we do an initial consultation with the patients in of course\n close collaboration with the treating neurologists and the requirement that we need a psma scan within three months of the treatment because we need to see whether the target is expressed if you don't see anything on Imaging the treatment cannot work because there's no target patients need to have had chemotherapy which is usually a toxin a capacity tax cell or any other Taxi and treatment there need to be at least one chemotherapy that the patient had and there are certain lab thresholds because one of the side effects is it\n affects the blood count it can affect the blood count we also need to know what is called the performance status so patients still need to be mobile need to get around because if you get the treatment and you can't you can't get to the restroom then the radioactivity that is excreted through urine that can become a kind of an issue and a problem we also instruct the patients for some radiation safety aspects but I want to show you in a moment I think I show you a slide that this radiation is really not getting far out of the body it has a\n very short range and we clean up the room of course where we do the treatment to to have the next patient in a room that is not contaminated what is this performance status and they're just saying patients need to be performing zero one or two that is they have to be mobile they need to be able to get around they just wanted to show you what ecoc means here this is all set up right now so we give up to six Cycles in intervals of six weeks that's the standard protocol we have a very very primitive very primitive setup right now and I\n show you where we are going with this we have essentially two reclining chairs and and this is the real setup here you see how the radioactive dose is sitting in this container that is connected to the IV line that the patient gets and the patient doesn't stay more than two hours in our Outpatient Clinic and can go home can self-drive or can be driven home without any significant risk of any radiation contamination for family or friends and the reason why this is so simple is because the radiation that we're giving\n is shown in Orange here has a half-life of almost seven days but as you see it is blocked by aluminum foil so it really is not something that reaches very far and is easily blocked and patients are not a risk for the environment or for family members what we do recommend is that while the radiation is not dangerous but try to keep a kind of same microbial distance like three feet for three days you can be around children but keep three feet of distance three feet is easy to memorize keep three feet system that's the radiation doesn't get that\n far you can eat anything you want before and after the treatment you should take all the regular medication as advised by your physician and the insurance should cover the treatment and there are some tips that we give patients be careful with toilets washing hands with soap and water drink plenty of liquids because you will wash out the radioactivity but this is really very very safe what are the most common side effects of the treatment I think that's also important to know and it's really the usual side effect it's fatigue\n it's a dry mouth because some of the radioactivity gets into the salivary glands it's nausea changing bowel movements can be diarrhea or constipation the blood count can go down but it's really reversible taste changes can occur bone pain can flare up for a few days and there can be in very few instances some kidney toxicity but severe side effects in all the population studies were really extremely rare the patient usually compared to a chemotherapy that they had before and they said it's no\n comparison it's a walk in the park compared to that so how will we know whether the treatment will work and when we stop the treatment so I just this is my great art artistic skill here but you see how the PSA drops and that's a good response and in an ideal scenario after two seconds you should have a significant drop by 50 percent of your blood PSA you can also do this here where it drops a little bit and then we would continue treatment after two cycles and continue up to six Cycles now when I mention that there are there\n are reports now that in Australia one patient has received 16 cycles of this without any other health problems that occur through it and then you have some where the disease kind of stabilizes and then takes up and others where it's really going steep up and these are clearly patients and if that is the picture after two cycles that the PSA goes up where the treatment does not work and we should discontinue examples what that can look like you can have rapid non-response PSA keeps Rising PSA Rises dramatically or you can have this\n extreme examples of complete response PSA close to zero even zero after treatment it's not always the same sometimes we wait for three Cycles sometimes patients have great symptomatic improvements less bone pain then we would of course suggest to continue the treatment that's always done in concert and in discussion with the treating urologists because that's kind of a team team effort they the urologist will say well this doesn't work let's move to something else why does it take so long and you're not\n supposed to be able to read this obviously but I just want to highlight two things the one is this was 1987 and we got our approvals in in 2020 or so so in 1987 the target was discovered psma and it took us till 2020 to to get this uh to patients why is this the one is it takes time to do the basic science to prove that it is of value and to do the clinical trial the other issue is of course you need to go through the appropriate steps to convince the FDA that this is safe and effective so that takes it takes a very\n long time and when you look at our work here we started with getting data from Europe in 2011 then in Spring of 2016 we started our large clinical trials and then again it took us till 2020 to get to the FDA approval this is actually very fast approval process because usually drugs from the base to to Clinic takes about 10 years so we actually were quite happy that it worked that quickly there are opportunities and challenges the one is every patient gets the same dose for the treatment and that of course is something that is not ideal\n but that's the way the FDA was approved I think we could give more and higher activities that would be more effective to reduce the number of patients who do not respond and how much Target is expressed we don't know exactly how these scans are best looked at to identify the patients who are likely likely benefit from the treatment we don't know why they why patients don't respond it could be mutations it could be something that makes patients less sensitive to radiation and it could be a quiet abilities of the\n cancer to overcome or beat the treatment out as in any other cancer what is really important is to come up with rational combination therapies it's not going to be a single agent treatment we need more treatment centers I think if you believe that we will have 40 000 therapeutic studies a year in the United States then we need 70 treatment centers if each of these does eight patients a day so we we're far away from having that of course if we do four a day patients we treat four patients a day you need\n 140 treatment centers so you see the number is really really high we need to work first and kind of ironic when you look at this you think 1210 qualified workers is a very low number given the job market but finding 1200 people who know what they are doing in this very specific field is not easy so that's an initiative that professional organizations are doing right now to try to find Qualified Technologies nursing radiation safety front office janitorial Physicians it's a demand Supply imbalance the\n companies thus far not capable of robustly Supply the drug and patients are waiting we have long a large number of patients on the waiting list and that's a real real problem because there's only one company that's no artists right now that distributes this and if anything in the supply chain goes wrong then the patients will not get their drug within a year or two I would predict there will be two or three or four companies providing the treatment and then the supply and the availability will be much more stable than it than it\n used to be or then it is currently this was a major challenge in Spring where Novartis published the inability to announce inability to deliver pluvico and we thought then it was resolved in June Novartis resumes production but then it happened recently again and we published kind of a harsh criticism of Industry here because we feel that is responsibility of the industry to make sure that there's a robust Supply there are actually three papers in the Journal of nuclear medicine addressing this to raise awareness that this is a really\n big problem so that's uh the summary here pieceme Pet City Imaging can be done and used and should be reimbursed at any stage of the disease except you cannot use it to diagnose prostate cancer that is not covered by Medicare that's a biopsy diagnosis that not something that we can do pre-authorization is needed as for any commercial insurances not for Medicare patients it is Medicare approved it's included in the guidelines and it is now even spelled out in the guideline that it is suggested to be better than CT and\n bone scan for initial staging the therapy after taxing based chemotherapy the studies are ongoing to move it forward because I think sometimes we come in at the time where the disease has spread too far and then we don't have the Firepower to eradicate the disease the significant Supply problems I talked about and the shortage of treatment sites is also a very important issue so I showed you what it looked in the past or still actually now at UCLA but in the future we are building this here this will have eight infusion\n chairs this is going to open this summer and each of these infusions in a separate little room with its own restroom patients will stay about two hours with us and they'll be discharge and and go home and I think it would make a huge difference in how patients feel about the the treatment it's just a different level this is the center here another image it will treat prostate cancer will be the most frequently treated disease there do you also see the uh the the layout it's about three thousand square foot space it's going to\n be a very well received by patient and and patient cares in the integrated patient care is in the center of this activity this is the people who have done all the work over the last 10 years to get this going and get this done these are basic scientists the clinician scientists clinicians coming from all different areas of expertise including Urology Radiology radiation oncology nuclear medicine and they came from European sites to teach us they were earlier than we were to teach us how to do this and make sure that we we are\n successful so it's this I want to thank you for your attention to prostate cancer patients who participate in in their best support research the referring Physicians who trust us Prostate Cancer Foundation the national funding agencies the UCLA team of Johnson comprehensive cancer center UCLA health and David Kevin school of medicine and Dr Schultz for inviting me to speak and have the opportunity to start communicating with you thank you very much fantastic so we'll do a little questions and answers here and then it'll be lunch time so\n there's no pressure to stay on time well there's lunch coming up all right so the first thing I want to ask you is I want to leave prostate cancer for a minute because PET CT scan is it's kind of it's blossoming all around medicine so is there another area you're really excited about with PET CT the reason I'm setting this up is I'm looking at some of the Alzheimer's trials and now they're using the scans to look at plaques and to decide who would qualify for meds so is that an\n area you're excited about outside of prostate cancer are there another area there are quite a few areas first of all let's let's stay in cancer for a moment okay treatment monitoring so we use fdg PET CT in pretty much every every cancer patient now to find out whether the treatment works I think that's a very important area because often we didn't know whether it works because just looking at CAT scans is often not that informative but if your glucose metabolism goes down rapidly on the skin then you know the treatment\n works so that's important they do adaptive treatments where they adapt based on the on the Imaging findings in in many many cancers cardiovascular diseases are very important and that goes hand in hand with the brain studies because there's what you call cardiac amyloidosis and you know amyloid is one of the products deposited in the brain when you have Alzheimer's and that's also happening in the heart so there are Imaging probes that can look at amyloid in the brain and the heart and with FDA approval of some drugs whether\n controversial or not to to to slow the progression of Alzheimer's you need biomarkers to find out whether the treatment works so I guess again it's the most important aspect is if you do a baseline scan and follow-up scan you see whether the treatment works and I think that's one of the key strengths of PET Imaging also in prostate cancer is one of the key areas of importance that's interesting so the other thing I did before you gave your lecture is I looked at some of your old videos when you gave talks at Medical meetings yeah\n yeah and the reason I like them is because you were very honest so you were very passionate so here here's a couple of quotations that you said at a medical meeting that gets me excited so you know I can bring up some controversy you were very passionate you said when it comes to PET CT and these other areas you said quote exposing patients to a lot of radiation in this manner is a ridiculous argument so you're what you were trying to say is I think the perception is there's all this radiation but the that's not true\n this is not can you expand on that for a second I think I tried to say that in the on the Imaging portion because the radiation that you get from it from a scan is really really low it's absolutely not dangerous I I hope to watch my language again but I remember the study that was published in Radiology where the kind of the message was we create with CT Imaging enormous numbers of cancers just by the radiation that's absolutely bizarre a grotesque and it's really total nonsense it it created so much anxiety on the side of patients the\n patients didn't want to have good diagnostic tests because they felt you know they will get radiation treatment no it's not radiation treatment it's orders of magnitude lower even when you look at patients who had external beam radiation you get really high radiation doses subsequent cancers are extremely rare very rare they happen but it's really rare So when you get the radiation that we give to Imaging it's homeopathic in fact many people believe that a little bit of this radiation is\n actually healthy no okay so then that was the one thing and the other thing if you want to comment on you were very passionate at these meetings and you said there's there's too much discussion that Imaging is costing money in terms so we're we're a small fraction of medical costs to the system and we need to change that perception too can you say something about that yeah so it was always you know you you in all the review articles you read the standard sentences Imaging is very expensive and and but when you look at\n healthcare costs it's really Hospital expenditures uh the quaternary care the the Imaging component I think I calculated it once is was one it actually was one percent of Medicare ex expenses and then the one person was actually too low for the reviewers of this paper so I've kind of faked it up to 1.\n 5 percent but I mean it's you can't you can't talk about expensive without looking at much more complicated models which decision tree sensitivity whatever analysis you really need to find out what the downstream consequences of incorrect diagnosis are and then figure out what the real cost so this is a this is a science by itself and just that you know there's a defense mechanism mechanism from insurance companies and so that they say it's expensive so we don't want to pay no that's good to know because I\n you still deal with that today that what we just talked about people think it's a lot of radiation exposure they're second cancer so I'm glad you answered that now let me let me take you to a couple questions we talked about in general let me know what you think so you're dealing with a lot of your Radiologists in the community and are they having trouble I know you guys are a center of excellence for these scans but look I live in Michigan other people are in different communities are they having trouble\n doing accurate interpretations of these psma scans because that would be a concern of mine it takes a certain amount of experience there's clearly a learning curve yeah and I mean I made my mistakes as a learning curve there's no question I I do think that a few hundred scans should do it you if you do a few hundred but whether you want to be the first 20 patients is a different question but it's you know Radiologists are usually very good very well trained and I think they can figure it out but the more training\n the better there's no question and there's no real there's no real regulation of how much change you need to to read psma pet scans but if you had a situation where someone's just starting to do scans and you know there's no difference surgery or it's over in pathology people get second opinions right they say well I want an expert so we know you're one of the places in the world that has read the most scans is it unusual or do you entertain or get excited about the possibility that\n people say wait I want you to also read my scan as a second opinion yes it happens uh happens quite often and and I have no problem doing this and you know we get either any CD-ROM mail to my home address or to the to UCLA and you know we're happy to do that now of course if it's thousands that come it would be a little bit of a problem but it's but we do it we do overreach I mean after this little privy thousands yeah I'm sure so and then Mike so I know it's not free for you to read my scan as a second\n opinion do you have an idea of what it might cost I think it's maybe 80 bucks or something how much 80. you say eight zero or eight zero zero no eight zero maybe it's 100 but it's it's not high really yeah and okay if you know the Imaging business a little bit on network well then so if I'm sending my scan to you as a as another opinion you must have received a bunch of them are you seeing I don't want to get you in trouble are you seeing are you agreeing with the initial opinion or are you seeing a lot\n of times going wait a second why are they seeing that no their cases where we see differently that doesn't mean we're necessarily right but we see it differently what bothers me more uh is that we do pet cities with a fully diagnostic CT and the fully diagnostic pet skin there's still many places who don't use intravenous contrast for CT Imaging and data fan problematic because you're trying to find little lymph nodes and need to differentiate them from smaller structures then I think that's something that is probably\n that's an issue for me but not only with psma it's with every every uh PET CT scan I think that the the diagnostic quality should be highest for the CT component and the pit component and that is sometimes not the case so just to finish this portion let's say I want you to read it at your house or at the medical center there's a place on the website that says this is where you could do a second opinion or I don't know how good we are with websites but uh there's clearly a contact that I will\n provide if the email comes to me until mail it to to whatever it is yeah and again it will be uploaded in the electronic you know record system and then you would give us that contact yeah okay how about the pet scanner machine itself because you have a certain pet scanner does it make a significant difference in the quality I don't of the psma pet I mean when I look at the old you know we started Pet City in 2001 I believe and we had a very primitive CAT scan component and that of course you cannot do anymore because they were simply not\n the label that they are now but whether you take you know GE or Siemens or Toshiba whatever you take they're pretty much the same they're same okay yeah there are new devices that are spectacular that can do very different things it's called total body pit where the whole body is in there and they have a resolution that is just really really better the unfortunate part is the cost they are so expensive that it's currently not feasible so they will be used mostly in government-run Health Systems where the government\n invests in programs and then and the other question I want to ask you in terms of and then we'll jump back to the psma pad so with this whole lutition pluvicto problem in terms of Supply there's some but now we're near to meet demand there is a I don't know if you call it a brother sister a cousin product that people are talking about and going to Germany for and it's called actinium and actinium is the next it's the next uh radio alligator product that people are going to get excited\n about after pluvicto wouldn't you agree and but I just want to know what how you feel about this activity because there's clinical trials going on City of Hope there's people that travel outside the country to be treated with actinium now they pay cash what are your feelings about this next treatment that may or may not down the line get FDA approved so a Continuum is clearly more potent than lutitsu more potent yeah but it's not available what companies are working on now is\n trying to bypass the salivary glands so that you don't get this yeah and the other is you know ramp up the availability which is probably currently you wouldn't be able to supply one percent of the need if it's about actinium so people try to come up with Technical Solutions to make it more available it's not there yet but the other Alpha meter emitters coming there's lead there's a terrible name who wants to get injected with lead yeah but it's absolutely not dangerous because the lead is in such low\n quantities that that doesn't but it's it's LED and that's generated produced and that's probably more likely to happen I think in the in the in the foreseeable future so these are patients that would if they didn't respond or if they had a response to pull Victor or stop responding they could then possibly go you're excited that they could possibly then get this as the next option not yet because yeah in the US and even I mean in in Germany it would be cleansing trials in Australia there\n will be clinical trials we are working on on pre-clinical work to find out what the safety because you have to go through the motions you have to do small animal studies to find out what the toxicity profile is and so on so it's the good news is industry is playing in so you have about whatever 50 companies in this diagnostic space that to me is a good sign because when industry Buys in they believe that this is really a big deal yes and then and then I think it's going to happen how long it will take is is open I don't know yeah I made\n a little sign here for the video this actinium that people are excited about so I'll move on from there but I have to go to Vegas for a meeting from here so if I'm at the roulette table or at the black deck am I betting that am I betting that this is going to be successful in a couple of years are you that's all in my betting that I think this is going to work in a couple years or not if you had to just be a betting individual I am not good at most most of them lose my bits so okay so then I don't want you to bet it has cost me\n many good bottles of wine okay so then I don't want you to bet but I think it will take more than two years it will happen but it will take more than two years so here's a topic I don't see people talk about a lot but it's near and dear to my heart when it comes to the psma scanning all right before you had psma scan if you went for other scans action and scans if you went for choline scans the patient was told to depending on the situation stop stop significant exercise within 24 hours and or fat and fast they couldn't eat on\n some of these other scans like a choline and you're saying there are no issues with fasting eating if you get this scan you're not concerned that anything could interfere so eating no because with fdg we do it because with glucose Imaging because you eat you change insulin you get sugar into your muscles exercising the same thing exercise I'm not sure because I don't know what exercise does to your amino acid levels yeah lipid metabolism they call in I don't know what it does so exercise I would\n just maybe not exercise the day before or something but I've never heard anybody say that are you talking about for your scan for your psma no for any PSA major or any psma you would tell them they exercise okay no no I would say they should not they should not but because for psma it doesn't matter but for calling for college metabolism fpgs against metabolism don't exercise but diet really only for fdg scans not for you don't have to worry about an impact of diet on your colon uptake or calling parents so do\n you use others do you use the do you use the glucose the fdg scans at all in prostate cancer are you still in other words a lot of questions that we got from the audience is let's say I'm not seeing anything in your amazing scan should I go ask for a different type of scan like the glucose scan the fdg pet what do you think so in in very Advanced disease when the psma scan can be negative so people have linked to the neuroendocrine phenotype and then fdg can get Negative and then a PSA can get negative so that\n the cancer so de-differentiated that doesn't produce psma anymore then fdg would be reasonable also before treatment with Pluto if you have lesions that have maybe low psma uptake then ftg could be helpful because if this High it shows you it's a different kind of disease it makes it much less likely that the patient will respond to Blue Victor so in Australia for instance every patients who undergoes treatment has both a psma scan and an fdg scan before so they get both scams before treatment yeah which we don't do for many reasons one\n is insurance coverage and the second reason is that if you see a lesion on CT right you see some mass or something that doesn't pick up psma then you know the treatment the treatment will not work because the target isn't there so I'm not sure that you really need the fdg scans it would be nice to have it yeah I'm not sure it's really needed what do you tell one of the greatest advertisements for a year I call it your scan if you don't mind because you know you're involved in it so I say you're\n scanned but it's really not I know sometimes yeah no I know so I'm saying here's here's what I've noticed a lot the advertisement was you know we can pick up something as low as 0.2 or they give a low number and people get excited right as opposed to waiting for your PSA to get one or two with the older scans then you would get a scan okay so you can pick up at point two but a lot of people go get your scan and they don't see anything at 0.\n 2 or 0.3 now what do you tell them so as I showed in the numbers when it's when it's between 0.2 and 0.5 it's probably around 40 percent only that we detect it so the majority of patients you will not see it so it depends many radiation oncologists would then just treat without you know without targeting anything because there's nothing there problem is on CT you will not see anything because these lymph nodes are the recurrent side is Tiny so you will not see it other people wait and say well let's do it again when you're 0.6\n PSA and and then treat I don't since we don't know outcomes we don't know with an intervention based on the Imaging really makes a difference we believe but we have no data to prove it I don't know so what's confusing a lot of doctors I've noticed is that okay 0.2 nothing on the scan let's just say this is someone had surgery right okay 0.\n 2 nothing on the scan point six nothing one nothing then why not get an MRI why not why not look for it with some other mechanism many many patients will get in any way but most of the time you don't see it most most of the time you will not find anything on MRI Edo some patients get an exumen skin they've got a different type of fat CT different different Pet City we compared that and it's clearly inferior to to to to to psma Imaging um yeah I mean the numbers are 80 when it's 1.0 but it's not 100 so what's the\n issue there the issue is either it's very small or it expresses low amounts of this psma thing on the cells then we will not see it if it's a large lymph node then we will probably just based on CTS and large let's say one centimeter yeah that range we will say it's probably the lymph node that we see can we prove it no sometimes you can perhaps it but I mean I think this is a big dilemma because you know PSA is called stands for in some cases prostate specific anxiety oh yeah right so as it goes up\n people are anxious and so you've seen people go to get choline or go get accident scans if they're not getting what they want with this you know I would be I think the best way to deal it's always honesty and say well you have an 80 chance that we find it or you have a 60 chance then many radiational colleges we simply treat yeah uh what is it does a bone scan do anything better than a psma scan in other words if I get a psma PET CT do I even need a bone scan anymore are they becoming obsolete so the nccn guidelines\n now suggests that it is superior to do a piece of my PET CT scan over a bone scan we tried to do a direct comparison we didn't get enough patients to really do it there's clearly no additional benefit of the bone scan in our experience so if you have a piece of my pet scan I don't think pet cities can you don't need a not only because of the PSA psma findings but also because of the CT findings because you see lesions very well bone lesions on the on the CT scan so you know I personally don't need the\n bone skin but it's part of the the staging that led to certain treatment algorithm is based on CT and bone scan so we see more now how do you deal with this as a urologist or uroncologist what you do with the information you don't know whether if you go after specific lesion it will be it will be beneficial how do you define oligom metastatic disease when you suddenly have a bone skin with three lesions and psma skin with eight how do you how do you incorporate that that's all unknown nevertheless I believe the no you the\n more you know the better is it is going to be at least in the future because you gain knowledge experience and eventually will know how to best manage it so if PSA is rising if it's high enough you feel really good about psma how about these other situations that are happening let's say you're on hormone therapy say your PSA is low it's kind of playing around at a low level can you can you tell me is some of the limitations of the psma scan that when you're responding to treatment that you it's\n not or do you feel like you could still use it in some circumstances so we have a very small series of patients where we image before and after hormone therapy okay and again it's very difficult to to do this you know because nobody pays for the scans and it's um and there's not much there doesn't seem to be much of an impact of the hormone treatment on what we see as Pismo expression on images and I know there was this old study about Tom hope that came out where it said it has an effect on psma expression\n it can have a little bit of it's not dramatic so for instance if you were to say I give hormone treatment do I stop hormone treatment to increase psma expression because that would make it more sensitive to the treatment yeah I don't think so wow okay again I can't prove it so I shouldn't be but I I think so well because at the end everything comes with a catch and so you know here's some of the catches that people throw at I I just want to keep coming keep coming you're a scan yeah here's here's some of\n the criticism okay here's some of the questions we get and I know the criticism but everything comes with a catch just my first question is how long is the waiting time I need to get a scan to uh next week at UCLA how long is the waiting time right now to get a scan because remember in the old days that waiting time got pretty long before no the waiting time is approximate I mean the the rate limiting step is really the insurance authorization for Medicare patients it's less than a week less than a week and for insurance authorization\n can take longer and it's very aggravating for everybody referring physician patients and us also because it's like you know the phone tree thing and you get the obnoxious music okay yeah so that's that's that's not helpful but it should be more than two weeks and then if I get my scan approved I should be able to get in in two weeks right so that's exciting and then how long does it take you to read it on average we did it the same day or the next day but when the patients come in before I would say one o'clock it's the\n same day and then we read it and then the report is either on the system the same evening or the next day okay so that's the latest that's great and then how long does it take me to just go through the the procedure itself and in the scanner so you you the way we do it this patient comes in is going to be injected with the isotope there's an uptick period of about an hour then the patient goes on the scanner we do a whole body scan then we ask the patient to avoid to go to the restroom and then we do just the pelvis yeah and that\n whole Imaging including getting off the skin and on is probably 45 minutes waiting time plus scanner and then everybody's late calculate two hours and some two hours probably total spending in the clinic two hours total because you remember when I say you remember they're still around bone scans but you have to wait because yeah it takes much longer to accumulate on the moon but you guys are implying which makes sense that you probably don't you know many people don't even need bone scans anymore this does everything what\n about everyone's using MRI just for initial diagnosis and biopsy but a lot of people are arguing that PET CT should be used in complicated cases possibly to diagnose do you think that it's going to be used earlier and earlier to diagnose significant tumors like MRI is used today so there's of course a lot of research ongoing and we have studies at UCLA also to find out whether we can see clinically significant prostate cancer in patients when one is not so sure yeah and in the ones where you're pretty\n convinced that there is cancer but the MRI doesn't see it so I don't know the answer how good it will be you get sometimes very focal uptake in prostate cancer and then it's hard to find it with biopsy because the anatomic fusion with what you to do your biopsy the CT fusion with the MRI or the ultrasound in this psma signal it's not trivial so you know you might not get to the right point I think it can be helpful because I know these centers are studying the effects of using both yeah yeah fusing it so you see promise in\n that well there's a pretty much scanner coming also the juicy will be interesting to see how much that can help so let's talk uh about some more I call them Achilles heels the word false positive and false negative is not a fun two words to hear true um what are you worried more about with these scans false positives or false negatives or both and why no of course you you worry about both I would say that I so first of all the term prostate specific membrane specific memory anti antigen is a misnomer that's right\n because psma is expressed in in several other tissues and and and also in in the blood vessels to sprout into other tumors so we may we have detected colorectal cancer with pcme imaging because it lights up and you know it cannot be prostate cancer then it's going to be biopsy then you find out the false positives that we see can be very worrisome because they can be anywhere in the body and benign bone lesions can have low uptake I'm very worried about false positives more than false negatives because first\n negatives I know what our performance is false negatives I know 40 sensitivity in patients who go to surgery means we miss more than half of the small lymph nodes still so I know what it is false positive is very hard because you can't go after each with perhaps you to find out whether it's real uh often it's clinically not such a problem because you have more disease you have you have like 10 lesions and it doesn't matter whether one is too positive or it's positive unless it's in a very\n awkward location so the other thing that I look at is try to look at the clinical information quite a bit so um the history is important if your PSA doubling time is very fast the PSA progression is very fast then chances are that is much higher than it's too positive it's something simmering at the low level kind of we get more concerned the other thing is the CT you have to look carefully at the CT they reduce the number of you know Radiologists have a pretty good Gestalt idea of uh you know what malignant versus benign you know good\n versus bad looks like on the CAT scans so so when the PSA is moving like the velocity it's going at a nice Pace you feel more confident that what you're seeing is real I would say that in most cases I feel confident there are some cases especially when the PSA optic is the psma optic ligand binding is low you see a little bit of you have a lymph node with a little bit of uptake in an unusual location okay well you have a bone lesion you have a little bit of a bone uptake that we know already we learned that if\n you have a solitary mild uptake in a rib it's usually false positive so I mean you you learn by doing it and and you have to stay critical just well you have to look up you also have to you see something in a very odd location you have to look into the literature and see has something been reported on you know an uptake in some other disease well that's why you're in trouble for admitting that you do second readings because that because that's my that's my worry right it's someone that's a novice at this is seeing\n something and they're not sure if it's false positive false negative I'll give you a classic example if you looked in the literature there was a discussion at psma and all these isolated rib lesions you remember all this data and so that freaks people out because they think they've got metastatic disease and it turned out a number of those were false positives right am I get that correct if it's a solitary rip lesion most of them of us but solitary riblings and most of them ended up being false positive yeah\n and that comes from retrospective studies but it's a yeah there's there's also different psma compounds that are kind of coming up in in Europe yeah one of them has is known to give you tons of false positive rip lesions so if you know that then you can deal with it uh it aggravates your oncologist in Europe to a great degree because they say what what do I tell my patients now what do they do with that yeah another term that a lot of people write about on the questions and because a lot of people will look at their own report\n and they'll look at the impression and then they'll you'll see these words used a lot it's called SUV could you can you just kind of explain that when someone's seeing this value that says SUV I know it sounds like an automobile yeah but it's not right so it's called standardized uptake value it's not a car and it can you explain it's higher it makes higher makes you feel more confident lower can you just kind of give a brief overview of why this is used so much when you read these scans it gives you a\n kind of an indication of the intensity of psma expression so if you have a lot of psma usually the the uptake of the of the of the isotope of the Tracer will be higher so if you have a number that is let's say above 20 or double the uptake of the liver as a reference organ then you will see the optic is intense or you can normalize it to Sally break land uptake so we have ways to look at it but it actually denotes the amount of radioactivity that ends up in a lesion of the injected dose that how much of that goes into a lesion the more then\n the more psma expression you have and I would say the more likely it would be that the psma targeted treatment can be effective so is there a cutoff value that I should look that someone should look for and Report SUV of what number did you throw out did you say we can take 10 you can say double the uptake in the liver you can say we would we would qualify it we would say kind of give in the in the in the in the impression low medium or high okay and and then there's also heterogeneity some of the some of\n the lesions in the single patients can have low uptake and others in the same patient very high uptake that's not a good thing for treatment because you will have lesions that will not respond very well I'm always looking for criticisms of psma that I haven't thought about even though I know it's completely changed medicine here's one that came from urologists that's well known and been at this meeting I won't I won't mention the name but I don't know if this is still true or not so it says\n some Studies have estimated 20 to 30 percent false positives but they believe heavily irradiated heavily irradiated non-viable prostate cancer could remain psma positive is that true anymore or not in other words if I've had radiation to an area it can can prostate cancer that's no longer viable or dead or not living tissue connect throw off some PSA out there psma out there if it's dead and it's really essentially Scar Tissue fibrous tissue no because the psma needs living prostate cancer cells but I agree\n there are false positives in the in in the in the in the prostate bed that can be false positive they can be sprouting enough of small vessels so one has to be careful in lymph nodes I would be very surprised if they're in typical location if they're false positive they usually are real okay that's easier overall and then what about can you say one more I'm over I apologize we want in by 12 30 but um different PET CT different tracers are excreted excreted or the body gets rid of them in different places right\n so with with pet with the psma that you use the product gets excreted through where the liver liver and the kidney to the bladder and the bladder so that's why we send the patients to the restroom and do an extra pelvic view okay so after they void then you empty the bloody and bloodline than you but the bladder lights up and the prostates near the bladder so when the bladder lights up what if there's a tumor that's near the bladder can you pick that up or is it get pushed out by the brightness of the product and the bladder itself so\n again you know we have the CT scan and the pit skin so we know where the blood is and where the process is so we can we can see that but the other trick is really devoiding so you you empty the bladder then you get a cleaner look it's also that if it's real that's another true positive sign with responsibility 50 optic keeps going up so on the pelvic view is laid on it gets hotter then it's real if it goes down then it's more likely to be benign okay and then there are some surgeons I found\n out in the country that are getting uh psmas and when it doesn't light up before surgery they won't do an extensive lymph node dissection anymore they'll they're confident that there's nothing in the lymph nodes they may sample one lymph node have you heard about this I mean I've got I've received a couple of these calls that they have such confidence in the psma if they got it before surgery that they won't do an extensive lymph node dissection just to sample the lymph nodes I think the data that I showed\n should raise caution here because if the sensitivity is only 40 percent yeah for what can be detected during surgery I would think that more than 50 percent will be still still possibly there so that's good to know so we are we're not that advanced yet to that point over over overall all right is there is there a question I should have asked you that I didn't that you really wanted to answer that was going to make UCLA and psma shine even more like you don't need any more attention than you guys are getting\n that you guys and gals but I think we are so great you just made one mistake you had the USC Marching Band I know about it I appreciate your candidness I I appreciate that overall are you in touch with all are you in touch at all people in Europe and in Heidelberg and we're out there doing in there because people from California and other places are flying over there to be treated what I didn't say is that the Novartis actually stopped delivery of public to for the next four to six months so I'm talking\n to patients all the time in there are several places that I know the people in in Germany all of them pretty much and they can still give the product yeah and it's it's uh you know precisely it's probably no more no more it's very expensive but it's much less expensive than it's like ten twelve thousand dollars here it would be if you pay out of pocket like 40 50 60 000 yeah so but you can't get it here that's the problem exactly so I just wonder who you're talking to in Europe where they can\n still do these things is it University of Heidelberg that is its Essence it's Heidelberg it's Munich it's it's pretty much all over all over the place and so you'll help patients if they run into trouble just at least knowing who these people are and how to contact them I do it and you've made a lot of promises here no I do it this is great I don't do it all the time that's fantastic you know I didn't have a cell phone until it was 60. now I'm kind of victimized so no we\n do it all the time okay so I'm gonna have to let him let you go but I got a couple side things for you that have nothing to do with today I think we've covered a lot and um by the way are you a runner did you run marathons yeah do you know how I got that what because I watch again you could call I call this investigative work some people call it stalking no but what I uh did was I went and you you kept referencing about you know a marathon you know the the joy you feel when you finish a marathon I thought\n only the only person that talks that way is a runner yeah but I didn't do many marathons it was very slow but I was a soccer player and I still plays a till 6 weeks ago till I pulled my hamstring I played soccer now my career is over well you no that's okay because you needed plenty of time to do more of the second opinion readings that you're going to be getting okay so we have a couple of gifts but first I want to tell you what you and I share we share a very strong bond and I haven't even met you till today\n um I've seen you at meetings exchanged some pleasantries but um you went to the University of Vienna for your md I know two world famous celebrities to me that went there let me see if you can recognize no no I'll show you can you bring up that picture I want to see if he can guess who these two celebrities are that also went to the same University I wanted to get his MD one and undergrad in the 60s and uh can we bring up my first slide there it is oh do you you can look down here too we've got it down here oh no it's going good\n any idea whatsoever if you get this I'll buy you dinner tonight and then you'll read my psma scan head on is she an actress she an actress oh my gosh you just made my mom's day that's my mom and dad so my parents went to the University of Vienna my dad was the first Iranian to uh graduate from the University of Vienna medical school and my mom was an undergrad and my mom said that my dad used to follow her around campus so she finally gave in and they went out that's understandable so that's my parents and so can you so\n my mom is 86 my father who was my superhero doctor passed away a few years ago but I thought it would be a nice moment because there's like a bond at the University of Vienna it's unbelievable my chairman goes there every year and can you play so I told my mom that someone from the University of Vienna is going to be here he's world famous and she said I want to say something to him and in German so can we play this my mom this is my mom just in 20 seconds and one from because she spent most of her life in Vienna and her whole\n family's still there it's nice [Laughter] um foreign you know basically she's saying that it was it's an honor to have you here and congratulations on everything that you've accomplished because she's another proud graduate at the University of Vienna but she was born in Vietnam she was born in Vienna she's still her entire family is still there she's the only one who recognized to be in his accent yeah that's what she said that's what she said you would recognize it and\n so I said Mom just say any three senses and I swear if you kept me on the phone for four hours going is I gotta make sure that he understands this send to him my best regards thank you very much this will absolutely make great days it's part of my way of saying thank you so much and thank you for being a part of this and congratulations on all this success it is amazing thank you so with that we have to give two gifts again Mozart cooglin is the most famous chocolate from Vienna you can imagine we used to eat it as kids and then I\n thought one great cup for you would be I use this mug periodically it says it's the periodic table it's a nerds cup so it's a perfect one thank you very much I really appreciate it thank you Dr chernin and thank you Dr moyad okay so now we're going to transition we have a sponsored talk by Jansen Pharmaceuticals and they're going to be talking about hormone therapy and prostate cancer they're going to give us some details about hormone therapy itself but also the side effects and what to expect presenting this talk is\n the medical director of the prostate cancer program at UCLA his name is Dr Matthew reddig he's a medical oncologist and he's been a good friend of the pcri for quite some time he does a really great job of contextualizing prostate cancer but also talking about quality of life and whether or not this is the right decision for you so thank you Dr reddag for being here we really appreciate it without further Ado here's this talk thank you so much thanks for that introduction so yes my name is Matt Reddick I'm a medical oncologist that\n focuses in genital urinary malignancies especially prostate cancer I work both at UCLA as well as the Affiliated VA Medical Center where we see a lot of patients with prostate cancer the most common cancer amongst veterans Far and Away um so we'll get started so we're talking about prostate cancer this is more of a educational overview and the title of the talk is understanding the challenges empowering yourself and so here are the learning objectives first we'll provide an overview of prostate cancer and then I'll go over\n the role of androgens male hormones and and how they function in the context of prostate cancer and then explain a disease progression so start off with the state of prostate cancer so these are statistics from 2019 and the relative frequency of these cancers is the same but the incidence of prostate cancer has been going up we're expecting in 2023 about 275 280 000 cases and in 2023 we expect it to be the first year that the incidence of prostate cancer will be greater than that of breast cancer so the previous slide was incidents this\n is mortality so lung cancer is the number one killer of men and women prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality and it's the number one um uh cancer in terms of mortality in non-smokers and the numbers are are increasing over time again these are 2019 statistics and essentially since 2018 the number of deaths attributable to prostate cancer has increased by about 1 000 per year so that in 2022 although we don't have the final numbers in we expect 34 500 deaths attributable to prostate\n cancer and here are the risk factors age is a major risk factor in fact prostate cancer incidence increases with age more rapidly than any other malignancy interestingly we can identify prostate cancer in men who are quite young in their 30s and 40s and in autopsy studies of men that have died from another cause when one examines the prostate we see about 20 to 30 percent of patients even in the 30s or 40s having evidence of prostate cancer most of these cancers that can be detected on autopsy are not clinically significant\n another important risk factor is race African Americans have the highest incidence about double that of caucasians and Hispanics and Asians have a low risk than Caucasians interestingly geography is important so whether irrespective of race uh men in North America have a very high incidence of prostate cancer so if you take age-matched blacks from Africa and and blacks from the United States we see that the incidence is much higher amongst the American blacks interestingly when um when men immigrate to the United States\n their offspring then have a higher and higher incidence of prostate cancer consistent uh with the statistics for men that have been in uh whose families have been in the United States for multiple Generations indicating environmental factors playing an important role in the incidence of prostate cancer a family history is also important there can be patients who have inherited genetic cancer syndromes where there's a specific Gene that is mutated and predisposes to prostate cancer there are also and more commonly clusters of\n cancers including prostate cancer amongst families that are not attributable to a specific Gene but perhaps to multiple genes or shared environmental exposure that can predispose to prostate cancer and then you can see other risk factors including diet as we mentioned obesity there's question whether or not smoking really has uh plays a role in in risk for prostate cancer and the same thing holds for some of these other risk factors that are listed here like vasectomy that's really not been clearly demonstrated as a risk factor for\n prostate cancer so most patients in the United States are diagnosed by an elevated PSA without symptoms patients of course can develop symptoms either local symptoms related to the prostate such as urinary symptoms occasionally blood in the semen erectile dysfunction and then if the disease is more advanced metastases can cause symptoms related to the site of involvement so if it's in the bone it cause bone pain or generalized symptoms such as weakness fatigue loss of appetite and weight loss in terms of screening and diagnosis so\n PSA is a screening tool there have been various recommendations by the U.S preventive task force in 2012 the U.S preventive task force actually recommended against PSA screening based upon the results of studies demonstrating the benefit of screening as well as the benefit of treating localized prostate cancer the U.\n S preventive task force in 2018 partially reversed course and said that men between ages 50 and 69 should consider screening and that should be a shared decision to be made with their doctor they still stand by the recommendation against screening in men's 70 or older I personally think it's a it's a individual decision that takes into account multiple factors such as patient risk factors life expectancy Etc and of course the diagnosis is made by a biopsy uh this is a slide that just shows how men can deal with prostate cancer and\n there's a spectrum of responses um you can patient can have a proactive approach to take a more practical approach without any emotion and then some men feel confused especially at the outset when they don't have much information and don't necessarily ask the right questions or know what questions to to ask and then some patients really feel hopeless and that there's no choice I should point out that irrespective of the stage at diagnosis the disease is really eminently treatable and it is associated\n with many many years of life expectancy and most men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer will die from another cause other than prostate cancer and that's true even of patients who have aggressive features in their prostate cancer biopsy or have a high PSA so let's turn to the role of androgens in prostate cancer so androgens is the term that collectively refers to male hormones most prominent one being testosterone okay so what you see here uh are the different clinical States and stages of prostate cancer on the left is localized\n prostate cancer where the vast majority of men are diagnosed on the far right is metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer so castration resistant may not be a very palatable term but it's an accurate term indicating that suppression of male hormones through medical castration with drugs like Lupron has stopped uh uh in its efficacy and the patient's cancer is worsening and therefore they have castration resistant prostate cancer and of course when they have metastasis it's metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and\n that really is the lethal form of the disease that accounts for the mortality associated with prostate cancer to the left of mcrpc are the two states that are precursors to it metastatic illustration sensitive prostate cancer and that's a patient uh would describe a patient who has metastatic disease and is first going on hormone therapy and is therefore castration sensitive non-metastatic crpc and the purple circle is a patient typically who's been on hormone therapy after for a PSA recurrence after surgery or radiation go\n on Lupron and is on it for many years and then ultimately the castration resistance State develops is manifested by a rise in PSA but there's no evidence of metastasis on conventional uh Imaging so that patient would have non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer importantly throughout the course of this disease including in the metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer space the male hormone environment is still critical for the survival proliferation growth of prostate cancers so even though it's castration resistant\n the tumor still uses the hormonal milia and activates the male hormone or Androgen receptor but it does so in a manner that is no longer dependent upon the testicular source of male hormones so how do we determine if there's a disease progression of course we have blood tests the PSA being the most obvious one and the testosterone should always be co-monitored with the PSA because there are patients who are on hormone therapy and who have what's called testosterone breakthroughs where the testosterone does not remain low and\n is no longer in the cash rate range so that should always be a check that the testosterone to confirm that the patient is still castrated of course we also have Imaging to determine whether or not the patient has developed metastasis or existing metastasis have worsened so pre-existing metastatic sites can have grown or new metastatic lesions develop and the conventional Imaging that is classically used are radionuclide bone scan so-called bone scans as well as CAT scans of the chest abdomen and pelvic to look at the soft tissues like the lymph\n nodes liver lungs MRI can be used although it's not used so much for Imaging of metastatic disease but rather it's it's an effective tool for Imaging the prostate especially in patients who are undergoing initial evaluation and staging for prostate cancer foreign prostate cancer the most common state of the disease at the time of diagnosis and there are multiple approaches for patients who have low grade unaggressive forms of prostate cancer active surveillance is a really good option because most men will not succumb to\n that illness will not succumb to prostate cancer of course there are therapies that are implemented with Curative intent and that would be either surgery radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy which is often combined with hormone therapy in patients who have more aggressive biology have high risk disease or something that we call unfavorable intermediate risk disease where concurrent hormone therapy with radiation has been shown to improve outcomes so androgens as I said are male hormones that are predominantly\n produced by the testicles so about 90 95 percent of circulating male hormones in an adult male are derived from the testis they're about five to ten percent that are produced by the adrenal glands and prostate cancer cells unlike normal prostate tissue can actually produce testosterone as a way of feeding itself if you think of a race car if you think of the male hormone receptor as the um uh or angioreceptor as the engine then uh androgens uh are the fuel that really need to get the engine going so when we\n treat prostate cancer we can either take away the fuel such as with medical constration like Lupron or we can block the ability of the fuel to actually activate the engine and those are drugs that like the glutamides the the bicoludomides the Dera glutamines the apollutamides that effectively block the function or action of androgens so um as I said the hormone therapy or Androgen deprivation therapy or medical castration is really the Mainstay the backbone of the medical treatment of prostate cancer and that\n um has been known uh since the early 40s when Huggins and Hodges published their seminal work showing that castration surgical castration or medical castration with estrogens was a way of treating prostate cancer in men and dogs Charles Huggins went on to win the Nobel Prize in 1966 for his work and then another Nobel Prize was given out related to prostate cancer in 1977 to Andrew shali who discovered the basically the lhrh analogs those are the lupron-like drugs and he did that at the Miami VA and is still working there and is in his mid\n 90s foreign deprivation therapy works by either blocking the production or action of male hormones the Lupron would be blocking production by impairing the ability of the testis to to produce testosterone and drugs like the lotamides bicolutamide uh enzolutamide apollutamide Etc block the action of antigens so now let's turn to the um third topic which is disease progression so um when patients are placed on anterior deprivation therapy or castration the overwhelming majority response typically by a rapid decline in\n the PSA as well as radiographic responses ultimately however if a patient is on hormone therapy for long enough they all patients will develop castration resistance and how long it takes to develop castration resistance depends on a number of factors including what stage of the cancer the patient is at uh the volume of cancer so if the patient has more metastases then uh or as compared to fewer metastasis and and other biologic factors including genetic factors of the tumor that can help or confer sensitivity or resistance\n to ancient deprivation therapy so we turn we talked about um this castration resistance and we also we also talked about non-metastatic history resistant prostate cancer as a a patient who's no longer responding to castration and whose PSA is going up but there is no evidence of metastatic disease on conventional Imaging and that's non-metastatic history resistant prostate cancer it's a state of the disease that we feel that is is shrinking in size because of the ability of Novel Imaging modalities molecular\n Imaging like psma pet scans to detect very small burden of disease that is not ordinarily detected with conventional Imaging now importantly with non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer there's a wide variability in the time that a patient to the time that a patient will develop a metastasis and um the the two features that are most predictive of time to metastasis are related to the PSA so the PSA doubling time with a PSE doubling time of less than 10 months predicting for earlier onset of metastasis or the actual PSA\n level a PSA of greater than 10 also predicting for earlier onset of metastasis and about half of the patients who have non-metastatic crpc will develop Obama tests at two years and a small percentage will even succumb to the disease so um we know that men of course can progress to metastatic disease and that can happen even in the absence of hormone therapy and that's uh of course that's what cancers do they they grow in an autonomous Manner and will ultimately uh uh develop metastases and metastities can be\n present at diagnosis which is shown on the left and that is called de novo or new metastatic orchestration sensitive prostate cancer alternatively metastatic disease can develop in the constants in the context of a recurrence after surgery or radiation so typically a patient will have surgery then develop a recurrence and if the recurrence the PSA is not treated the patient will eventually develop metastatic disease and that would be called recurrent metastatic orchestration sensitive prostate cancer so uh when we have metastatic history\n and sensitive prostate cancer basically that's an indication that the patient is metastatic disease and the patient is first going on hormone therapy so even though the patient hasn't necessarily received hormone therapy we call it castration sensitive meaning that if the tumor will respond or is responding to castration because basically all patients do in theory we can also call it castration naive metastatic prostate cancer but the these are are terms that refer to the same uh uh entity that is a metastatic\n tumor which patients are first going on hormone therapy and as I said the patients can a patient can have de novo metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer meaning that the diagnosis of prostate cancer is occurring when the patient actually has metastatic disease or they can have recurrent metastatic hydration sensored prostate cancer whereby the metastatic diseases occurring in the context of recurrence after surgery and or radiation interestingly de novo metastatic prostate cancer has a less favorable\n prognosis than recurrent disease which sounds counter-intuitive because we always think of recurrences as having a worse prognosis but in in the context of prostate cancer that is not the case it's the other way around so whenever we consider treatment for prostate cancer irrespective of age irrespective of stage we have to consider multiple factors so what is the expected life span for the patient so is the patient 105 or is the patient 55 and that's going to informed treatment decisions of course what are the other\n medical illnesses that the patient has that's important because it it can help guide therapy and there are some illnesses that could be in theory exacerbated by the treatment of prostate cancer alternatively some of the drugs that we use for prostate cancer can interact with drugs for other diseases and we always want to have a careful discussion about the potential benefits and uh downsides of treatment that is side effects uh potential benefit is in my view can be thought of in one of two ways does it ex does a treatment extend\n life expectancy or does it improve quality of life so the treatment options for metastatic orchestration sensitive prostate cancer and non-metastatic equation resistant prostate cancer overlap Androgen deprivation therapy such as Lupron is really the backbone of therapy for these disease States we also have the what we call anti-androgens these are the the drugs that are the ludamides that block the action of uh of male hormones importantly with metastatic illustration sensitive prostate cancer we've learned\n over the last eight years that engine deprivation therapy by itself is no longer considered sufficient or optimal to achieve the greatest survival benefit we now know that we add a second hormonal agent one of the luteamized or chemotherapy or even three drugs to to uh to serve as the the backbone of treatment we markedly improve survival much greater than if we reserve those same drugs for the castration resistant space the metastatic crpc space where the drugs have can have an improvement in overall survival but those same drugs\n when brought earlier in the disease course such as metastatic restoration sensitive prostate cancer have a much greater impact on life expectancy so um I think what we know is that patients can have uh three different areas where they may uh struggle uh in understanding their their prostate cancer these are uh there can be confusion about the states of prostate cancer uh which we've we've we've touched upon namely is it castration resistant orchestration sensitive is it metastatic or non-metastatic\n uh it's also um possible to have confusion over where that where is a patient headed in terms of their future treatment how long will the current treatment work how long is it expected to work what do we do if the treatment stops working these are all important questions that a patients should address with his physician so that there's a greater understanding when there's greater understanding that reduces Stress and Anxiety over their disease I think of course we need to understand what is what it means to\n progress to metastasis and whether or not metastasis is developed is developed that diagnosis or as a recurrence and whether or not the metastatic disease is castration sensitive orchestration resistant so my recommendation to you is really ask questions to your physician to your urologist your oncologist you can do your own research but don't make any definitive conclusions you can be misled by what you read on the internet there's a lot that goes into making a decision about prostate cancer a lot of different\n studies sometimes they studies can have opposing results on the same topic so it's important to have a discussion with your well-informed physician it's also important to focus on quality of life and what you can do in terms of diet and weight loss to optimize your ability to tolerate treatment as well as to extend your life expectancy so diet and exercise can do both um improve your tolerate your tolerance of treatment as well as extend life expectancy and of course you're going to ask your physician if your treatment's working we\n touched on this uh what's going on what will happen if my cancer progresses uh and and has my cancer progress to other sites of disease so I'm going to stop there these are patient resources that you can use uh of course you can use the pcri as an important resource and then the American Cancer Society the National Cancer Institute and others so I'll stop there and say thank you very much for listening and I I hope this talk has helped you in some way so that you can gain more control over your cancer and\n learn as much as you need to to make the right decisions for yourselves thank you thank you Dr reddig I really appreciate that talk if you have more questions about prostate cancer or hormone therapy and whether or not that's right for you you can visit our website pcri.org forward slash helpline and talk to our Advocates they can help answer some of your questions also thank you to Jansen we really appreciate your sponsorship in helping us present this today all right a couple things I want to remind you about you can donate to\n pcri.org we are a 501c3 nonprofit all of our services are for free and we're reaching hundreds of thousands of people around the world but there's millions of men dealing with prostate cancer and we want to reach more so if you want to partner with us whether that's on a monthly basis or an individual donation we really appreciate it you can do that at pcri.\n org forward slash donate I also want to remind you if you have questions regarding this conference you can leave them in the chat box on our YouTube page or any email us at info pcri.org as well our next presentation is by Dr Carl Rossi he's been a dear friend of pcri and spoken for us for many years now he's the medical director of the California proton Center a couple key things to know about him is he's been doing proton therapy for over 30 years and has done thousands of procedures he is an expert in this field and he's\n going to discuss the ins and outs of proton therapy and what side effects you can you know kind of expect in that situation Dr moyad is going to ask your questions that have previously been submitted and if you have questions during the talk our helpline is on with us now to answer I hope you find this presentation informative thanks so yeah you've you've you've known me you've known each other for years and you've watched my hair turn grayer and grayer as the time has gone by but that's just life right but thank\n you all for you know the invitation first of all and appreciate the opportunity to be here again it's also very very nice to actually get to see people in person without having to either hide behind Zoom or a mask or both which I think we're all over and done with um I like to remind people when I do a talk about radiation therapy like what are we doing it's it's mysterious enough people are scared of radiation right here you go to the dentist and they put a lead drape on you and we have all these warnings about it how does\n radiation kill things whether they're good or whether they're bad it does so by breaking DNA and that's what you see in this slide that is the target for all radiation therapy it doesn't matter whether it's a proton or an x-ray or a gamma ray coming off a brachytherapy source that is our Target and everything we do with our different Technologies is to try to create as many breaks in that DNA strand as possible why you break the DNA the cell can't divide it dies when it attempts to grow and we're very\n fortunate in that by by and large malignant cells not all of them but most of them are less able to repair that type of injury than their normal counterparts so you're somewhat more likely to kill the bad stuff than the good stuff and certain cancers the difference is great in many of them it's actually very modest and that can be make it more of a challenge to try to control them so you know the history of radiation therapy actually goes back to shortly after the discovery of radiation 1895 is when Renkin discovers x-rays baccarell\n discovers natural radioactivity within a year within a year of that people were you know using this as a weapon to treat primarily skin tumors and other things because they had seen that if you bombard somebody's skin with x-ray this funky thing would happen the skin would get red and fall apart so people started doing that well before the turn of the 20th century unfortunately there's a lot to learn right there's a lot of good things to learn and there were a lot of bad things to learn and one of the bad things that\n we learned is that radiation is a toxin no kidding we think you know that's intuitively obvious to us now but it wasn't even through the early days of the 20th century and the the monument you see there in the background of that slide is a monument in North Germany to what are called the radium Martyrs the men and women who in the early and not so early days of radiation therapy died because of exposure to the equipment that they were using a lot of Physicians a lot of physicists so you've always got\n to keep in mind that radiation is a powerful tool for good and it's also something which you cannot ignore because of this potential for harm we have some basic tenants that we use in radiation therapy that's our you know our Holy Grail whatever you want to call it you know the first is that there's no such thing as radiation resistance there are levels of it but if we give a high enough dose we can kill any living cell as I mentioned a minute ago malignant cells are somewhat less able to repair\n that damage and that's how we're usually able to kill cancers without killing the person that they reside in and there's a you know the toxicity of radiotherapy is beyond dispute but what is somewhat controversial is is there a threshold is there a level below which there is no harm and that has been debated for a long time it will probably be debated for a long time but we have a principle in radiation therapy the acronym is called alera a-l-a-r-a which means as low as reasonably achievable in other words you\n want to give normal tissue as low a dose as you possibly can because that's the only way we really know that we can avoid side effects that the one guarantee to prevent a radiation side effect is if I don't hit a tissue I'm not going to harm it and that's you know we'll be hearing a lot about that in the next 25-30 minutes so if you look at how we've Advanced radiotherapy you know kicking in mind what I just said a minute ago about you know how it works and this pros and cons we've done all of these things\n technologically to try to become more specific as to where we put the dose and all these modern Technologies really have some pretty you know relatively remote antecedents whether you're doing imrt whether you're doing protons whether you're doing implants they're all ways to try to use the physics of the modality to become more specific and why do we do that because we understand the physics a lot better than we understand what we'd like to understand and that is the fundamental radiation biology\n people were using radiotherapy as a weapon for over 50 years before it was discovered exactly how it works that picture I showed you early on about the DNA molecule that comes from the 1950s 1960s so half a century of delivery before understanding fundamentally what we were doing and now we know not all cells respond the same way in a tumor to radiation and there may be some cells that are radiation resistant because they have better repair mechanisms and some patients cannot repair damage as well that's also being elucidated for the\n time being we're stuck with physics so all of these different modalities are physics based that's the lever that we pull because it's the one that we can pull and if you look at modern x-ray therapy you know imrt very very good stuff what you can do is you can concentrate the radiation doses of course the prostate patient you can concentrate the radiation dose the highest doses in the Target whatever that Target might be the downside to doing this with x-rays potentially is that the beams don't stop\n to get that high dose here in the center this is a volumetric Arc plan vmap very good x-ray therapy to get that dose here you're giving a bath of radiation lower dose but still not insignificant to everything else is that clinically a problem most of the time it isn't we treat lots and lots of people every year and we cause very few severe injuries but there are issues with this and you know even if you take it up a level in a perfect world why should I treat this person's intestines and bladder if the problem is\n in the prostate or if I'm treating a breast cancer patient why should I treat her heart if I don't need to you just that's a compromise you have to make with x-rays because of their physical nature and this is how you know you'll hear how protons are different in that regard and the reason you know first of all what is a proton is subatomic particle comes out of the atomic nucleus in fact it's the most common particle in the universe the fact that it has a mass and an electric charge determines its\n properties when you shoot it into anything whether it's a person into a water tank doesn't matter the person who first discovered this difference this rather a gus looking gentleman here William Bragg 1903 he is working in Adelaide in South Australia and he is shooting helium ions into a water tank and he's measuring the radiation dose deposited as a function of depth and what he finds is that when the particles are going fast there's really very little ionization little radiation is when they come get slowed down and his\n last few millimeters of their travel you get this big spike of dose and then once you get to this point particle stops the dose drops to zero this is now called the Bragg Peak named in his honor William Bragg 1915 Nobel Prize recipient in physics for other work he did your typical underachiever he pretty much invented the field of X-ray crystallography but this is what our radiate proton radiotherapy is all about it's based on this physical phenomena remember pulling the physics lever again you can stop these particles at a point\n in space and not give dose Beyond them and give a lower dose on the way in the Australians are completing their first finally proton Center in Adelaide which is named the Bragg center it's supposed to open in either 2024 or 2025 they've named it after him in his honor which I think is pretty cool but you know when you look at how we do radiation therapy as a radiotherapy Community very few people have access to protons so far because of the expense because of the complexity Etc et cetera so most patients especially most\n prostate patients receiving external beam radiation they're treated with imrt intensity modulated x-ray therapy that's become our standard because it's really good treatment it lets you do things you couldn't do in the past when I was a resident we would learn how to draw squares and rectangles on a piece of X-ray film that's what we would treat did it work yeah you treat a lot of extra tissue heck yeah imrt computer control revolutionized that we're not going to turn the clock back on that but I think it's important to\n realize that this technology was introduced again purely because the physics of imrt looked better than the physics of its predecessors because I hear a lot and I've been hearing this for you know several decades now well you haven't done a randomized trial of protons versus imrt and I'll say you're absolutely right we haven't by the way where was the randomized trial of imrt versus 3D conformal good luck finding it was never done it was adapted as the standard because of that Improvement in\n physics and what's holding proton therapy back is to some extent the complexity which is getting the to be less of an issue and also just the cost of delivering the treatment which is also becoming less of an issue so Bragg discovers the brag peak in 1903 and you go fast forward to 1946 and you have this gentleman who if you've heard me talk before you know I'm somebody I deeply admire Robert R Wilson who was the physicist not a physician the physicist who wrote a paper in July of 1946 saying in effect you know if you\n could stop those particles where you want them to stop that's a good way to spare normal tissue his background born in 1914 he was born in a town called Frontier Wyoming that's actually the name of the place he got his PhD at Berkeley with Ernest Lawrence who was a Nobel prize-winning inventor of the cyclotron he was the youngest the vision head at Los Alamos during the second world war now he was in his early 40s in fact his division was responsible for separating u-235 from u-238 so much of the uranium that was used in little\n boy came from the labs that he was running and after he left you know the end of the war went back into Academia in the mid 70s he became the founder of the Enrico Fermi National Laboratory which is the U.S fund Premier fundamental high energy physics lab out there in Illinois he is also an architect he designed the headquarters building he built these multi-ton sculptures on site he ensured that there was a herd of buffalo because it's a prairie site I'm not making that up out there and he and his wife were actually\n buried there you know just just a fascinating fascinating man who I had the pleasure of meeting several times when he would come to Loma Linda great guy so proton therapy he writes his paper 1946. well that's great couldn't do it was first done in the mid-1950s that's this upper left-hand picture you can this is a picture from the Lord's Berkeley lab where they have protons coming out of this nozzle and they hope this is a head and neck cancer patient you can see how comfortable they look and how well immobilized they are that\n was what they best they could do then it wasn't until the late 1980s that a medical proton Center was built and that's the Loma Linda facility in this picture here on the right is from April 1988 at the groundbreaking I was just about finishing up medical school when they took that shot and the way Loma Linda was designed in the way that most of the new facilities of the facilities have been designed is as so you have one accelerator that serves multiple treatment rooms so you're not treating concurrently you're\n treating sequentially you're treating a patient and here while you're setting people up here here this is a schematic of our facility we have five rooms we have all sorts of other ancillary stuff including anesthesia for the kids that we treat but that is in the way that most proton centers were built until about seven or eight years ago and what's happened since then like everything else in science is that they've gotten smaller and you can now take this five room facility and you can make it the size of a tennis basketball\n court and it gets even smaller than that in November of last year Stanford announced that they're building they're going to build a one-room proton Center that fits in a standard radiation therapy Vault you don't need a bigger building you don't need this other ancillary equipment so once that comes to fruition that opens up lots and lots of possibilities smaller hospitals can get it etc etc the way that we deliver the treatment at all the newer facilities is we use electromagnetically scan beams think of\n it as a 3D printer putting in dose and layers through the Target that lets you get very creative it lets you give differential doses I'll be showing some stuff about that in a second it lets you treat really large really irregular shapes this is an advancement over the way that we did things back into when proton therapy was first being used clinically so if you look at our current status of proton of therapy United States we have over 40 operating facilities which is up from you know one when I started in this\n they're virtually all using scan beams if they can their majority of them now have the same type of Imaging that we use for x-ray therapy we take three-dimensional pictures of the patients each day to line them up and the majority of the new facilities are small they're one room they're two rooms which means that you can put them in more locations and as I mentioned a minute ago Stanford is going to be the next site in California to actually operate a proton Center unless UCSF gets off their Duff and finally beats them to\n the punch that's a map of where they are they're not evenly distributed the vast majority are east coast and Midwest in fact if you look at this map most NCI Comprehensive Cancer Centers have either have protons or they're getting them so you've got protons at Mass General and protons at memorial stone Kettering and Johns Hopkins and University of Pennsylvania Mayo Clinic et cetera et cetera Etc so this continues to grow largely because the machines have become cheaper and smaller and easier to\n install so we'll talk now about prostate cancer in particular this is a bit of a joke to myself a new en experimental treatment I hear this all the time I've been doing this for over 31 years and real patients and I'm still told by people who should know better usually Physicians oh it's it's new it's experimental there's no data nothing's ever been published on it etc etc well while I was digging around at work on Thursday and I came up with this paper which I was aware of this is\n the first paper in the medical literature about treating prostate cancer at a Mass General and it was published in 1979. so not exactly new experimental never been done nothing there isn't any data on it we've been doing it for a long time and there's a lot of data on it you know and as you'll see it's one of the many not the only way thank God one of the many good ways to treat prostate cancer how do you plan your patients pretty much the same way you do it with x-ray therapy everything is dependent upon\n making a three-dimensional model of what you want to treat and also dependent upon making sure the patient is in the same position each day and that's not trivial you know I showed you those Beams I showed you that Brad P coming to a stop that's two to three millimeters it's not easing to a stop so if I've got a patient and they're on the robotic table I've got to make sure that those layers of dose are being painted you know not in their hip but in their prostate not in the heart but in\n the breast Etc it all comes down the planning and doing things to make sure that delivery is accurate so in prostate the real key multimodality Imaging not just doing CT scans like we used to do in the past thankfully no doing MRI excuse me psma pet you know these things have revolutionized what we do they all show you something different the MRI and of itself shows you detail you don't get on the CAT scan and it can show you things like well hey here's an area I want to give a higher dose to because\n there's more disease there oh by the way here's a neurovascular bundle I don't want a tree or I want to spare that's data you get from the MR the pet of course can show you similar things and also other other areas you may want to hit these are all synergistic we're fortunate at the proton Center that I'm at where we have in one room MRI CT pet and regular planning CT they're all in a horseshoe so we can use them to our hearts content a substrate many of you are aware that the F-18 psma pet is has\n been around now being some expects for several years but really as a generally available tool for just over a year we started doing that at the proton Center in last it was October 21 as soon as Medicare started approving it and it's fantastic it lets you see things you wouldn't see otherwise and if you can see it you can Target it and that's exactly what we do you know again an example that I think almost everybody here is familiar with patient who has disease in the prostate also has a positive pelvic lymph node so guess what\n you can pile higher dose in that area because you know that area is involved now if you're doing your typical plan especially the way we did it a couple years ago you start with the CT this is back when we were using balloons a lot before we had hydrogel and CT just kind of gives you a grayscale image it doesn't tell you much beyond that but same patient that's the same person here's a multi typical multi-parametric MRI and you can see here in the right side of the prostate there is a discernible nodule\n that's extra disease guess what let's pile extra dose and if we can see it we can Target it we can hit it and that's exactly what we do in the planning this is looking at it using another another signal processing technique you see the same thing that confirm that's malignancy and then when you do your treatment plan it's a little bit subtle but you can see the hottest spot is right there where that disease was not just turning up the dose to the entire prostate trying to be specific as to\n where you punch the hardest that's looking at the same patient cut down the middle showing how we're able to stop the dose and avoid the bladder avoid the majority of the rectum okay let's talk some data does this stuff really work I mean again there there are lots and lots of papers there are over 700 papers that I'm aware of doing literature searches in the literature about using protons to treat prostate cancer and don't worry we're not going to talk about all but except maybe about two or three of them that's\n it so one of the ones I was pulling out when I was doing some research for this talk earlier this week is a really good really large data set from MD Anderson University of Texas they've had protons oh since I think about 2005 2006 and this is looking at almost 3 000 patients that they have treated there and they're different risk groups and all the things that you'd normally expect and they've been followed now for a long time the median follow-up is seven years some of these patients are twice that\n far out from their treatment and they've used the typical definitions of failure PSA going up you know more than two nanograms per ml the Phoenix definition and a cut to the quick here's what they found like everybody else sees in the low risk patients the ones we hardly ever treat anymore The Cure rates are incredibly High because the disease is so incredibly minimal now again these are patients that you probably never see now but yes I saw a lot of them up to about 2010 2012. but even for slightly more\n advanced disease the five and especially the tenure rates are good right you're over 90 percent free of disease and as you mow up this ladder of course these numbers come down but they're still relatively reasonable so you've got good long-term data in this study and many others saying that this is one of you know protons are one of the many ways in which you can control prostate cancer University of Florida did a similar analysis where they were comparing patients that they treated with protons\n at their proton facility to patients who were treated with imrt also at University of Florida again reasonably long follow-up the groups both had hormonal therapy generally about the same in either group a little bit more at the imrt you know first thing to point out there's no difference in the older patients in the outcome over age 75.\n they didn't see any difference at all which is something that's also very repeatable but when you look at the low-risk Patients again that group you don't treat Much Anymore there was about a five percent difference in disease-free survival in that between those two groups favoring protons they saw a slightly smaller difference in the intermediate risk patients and the high-risk patients they didn't find any difference whatsoever and the suggestion was that because they were giving a higher dose on the proton patients that's perhaps why they were getting a\n better outcome and when you talk about higher dose you worry about toxicity but if you limit the amount of normal tissue that you treat you can limit the toxicity and the stuff that we worry about in terms of side effects are what are called grade three or four or five events the showstoppers and they were extremely low in either group but they were somewhat lower in the proton patients probably because you treated less of the bladder and less of the rectum Northwestern has done a big database analysis also looking at their proton\n patients matched to radiation and x-ray therapy and probably the biggest points from this were first of all they did see a survival difference not is the disease present or not does it come back or not but is the patient alive and they saw that in favoring the proton patients why because of second cancers there were fewer second cancers in the proton patients but likely because there was less normal tissue being treated there's another paper I'll be touching on this in a little bit about the same thing and\n these were primarily cancers in the pelvis like the bladder and also leukemias the more normal tissue you expose to even moderate doses the more likely you are to cause those problems so if you can limit that you can reduce that risk to the individual and even though I have people I have doctors tell me well it's adults it doesn't matter like well you know 70 year olds are going to live 15 20 years it matters to them 75 year olds are going to live 10 15 years it can matter to them as well so it's not something that you just\n shove under the rug because a person is no longer 18 or 20 years old this was a another large review that we did was called the PCG proton collaborative group again just doing a big comparison where we're treating patients with Advanced prostate cancer with protons versus similar patients treated with imrt and what we found is that using protons to treat these patients because we were treating the pelvis they tolerated it better hardly a surprise you're not treating all this intestine like you have to with imrt to treat the\n pelvic lymph nodes now second cancers big it's big it's big deal protons are felt to be the treatment of choice in kids we hardly ever get any pushback from an insurer about treating a 10 year old 12 year old even about to age 21 oh no no problem what about adults oh that's that's all different I've had to fight I'm 22 and 23 year olds this paper came out of almost three years ago out of Stanford where they did a big big analysis I mean looking at lots and lots of charts and there's all\n the detail here and how they did it in essence what they did is they looked at the 10 most common adult cancers and they looked at patients who either got 3D conformal x-ray therapy which was the standard of the 90s our imrt today's standard or proton treatment and they looked at the rates of second cancer between all those different forms of radiation therapy to see if there was a difference and they found a couple things of course that were pretty interesting right the first thing they found was that between 3D conformal\n x-ray therapy and imrt there was no difference in second cancer rate which surprised a few of us we thought imrt might be actually a bit worse but perhaps the most important thing is that the rate of second cancers in the proton patients was less than one-third of similar patients treated with either 3D conformal or imrt and this wasn't just a statistical fluke because you see it across all the age groups you saw it in nine of the ten adult malignancies that were looked at the only one we didn't see a difference was in lung probably\n because of such a abysmal prognosis anyway and even if you exclude the prostate patients you still see the breast cancer patients you still see it they came up with this other you know analysis where they said you see this early you know it's not something that happens 20 years out you start to see this significantly as soon as five years after completing radiation therapy so there's not a lot of comfort in telling a 70 year old don't worry it'll take 20 years to get your second cancer if it's\n something they may see in five years this was the scatter plot they did with you know with all these diagnoses except for lung there was a much much much lower rate of second cancers in the proton patients versus those treated with x-rays well I showed you that picture earlier with the MRI where you could see the disease and this has become a very very uh hotly investigated topic now in prostate radiation therapy why don't we hit those areas harder right that's the concept what can you do to pile more dose in\n there there are lots of ways to do it we do it with protons people do it with brachytherapy people do it with x-rays and there are a couple studies that have suggested that if you do this you're going to get a better result in terms of cure the first one that got probably the most pressed on the radish oncology world this thing called The Flame trial and it was randomizing gentlemen to either radiation therapy to a certain dose alone versus radiation therapy same dose the entire prostate plus a boost within\n the prostate gland a significant boost and this was reported out about two and a half years ago and what they found was that there was a statistically significant advantage that's the red line in the patients who got that higher dose within the prostate both in terms of reducing recurrence in the prostate and reducing the risk of this disease showing up elsewhere if you destroy the cancer in the gland you do a much better job of reducing metastasis than if you can't so as a consequence of this type of data\n we're all doing what we can to try to boost the radiation dose within the prostate gland and they came up with some theoretical graphs saying if you could get the dose up to around 95 97 gray you may be able to reduce those local failures to close to zero and that's what we're looking at now we're giving doses in that dose range to see if we can really sterilize the vast vast vast majority of tumors in these patients so their conclusion as I've just alluded to is that higher doses were better\n that's that's the take-home message you know we have all the statistical stuff saying it's better it's better makes sense higher the dose you're able to give the more likely you are to destroy that cancer oligomet static prostate cancer nice big word huh it just means well it means different things to different people the definition of It kind of bounces around depending upon whose paper you read but in general it's felt that if you have five or fewer sites of disease outside the prostate whether those are lymph\n nodes or bone that's considered oligom metastatic or minimally minimally metastatic not widespread and you know back when I was a resident and up to not too many years ago we were all taught if you've got one side of metastasis you're going to have 100 that's just inevitable it's going to show up Here There and Everywhere but you know maybe that's not the case this is not a new idea again if you go look at the history of trying to treat these patients aggressively it goes back to before World War II there was a\n report in the literature of a patient with renal cancer solitary lungment had both removed surgically lived over two decades and died of natural causes never had a recurrence well now that our technology allows us to find these sites of disease early and also now that we have some pretty good systemic therapies maybe it makes sense to treat these patients aggressively this is an example of a patient I finished treating last week he had a solitary metastasis to a left rib and we were able is to paint the dose in\n the rib and spare you know the adjacent lung you can do this again with a bunch of different radiation modalities the point is that treating these patients aggressively seems to be beneficial in many ways to them and there have been a couple of trials that really opened up people's eyes this first one was called saber Comet as you may imagine part of having a good trial is having a good name good acronym for it you want to have something which kind of catches the you know catches the eye catches the ear this was looking at\n patients with all sorts of different histologies whether it was prostate breast cold and didn't matter and it looked at some patients who either got best standard treatment or the same standard treatment plus those sites were abladed with radiation they wanted to see if there was a benefit and of course you know again they found that there was you increased the median survival so the patients were more likely to live longer if you treated them aggressively you gave them a significantly higher five-year survival I mean these\n differences again are not trivial and you also decrease the rate at which they progress so at the very least what you get out of this if you treat these patients aggressively is you slow things down all right you're slowing down the progression in in the case of prostate cancers I'll show you in the next couple slides that means for many of these patients you're able to give them a holiday from everybody's favorite systemic treatment ADT so they have some better quality of life and the prostate\n water all I'm alluding to is this one's called the extend trial very similar to saber Comet except that they were looking at just prostate everybody got six months of hormone therapy half the gentleman at two months of hormone therapy got radiation to the sites of oligomyostatic disease the other half didn't there weren't that many patients enrolled this data is still maturing but it's very clear if you look at the results I've been published a date that they're highly favorable to those\n individuals who are treated aggressively you're able to keep them off hormonal therapy for longer after that six months has expired you're able to reduce the rate of progression in some of these Paces it had we haven't even gotten to the median side you know rate of progression-free survival yet that was our conclusion is that if you did aggressive stereotactic radiotherapy again whatever technique you have you're doing these patients a favor it's a win-win you're keeping them off ADT\n you're reducing the rate at which they progress so can we do this with protons of course I showed you a picture you know four or five slides back where it can do it you can do with x-rays the cancer cells could care less they don't know what they're being hit by that ionization that DNA damage is the same so we tend to get in protons the patients who have had high doses of Prior radiation in that area and we're trying to spare normal tissue because we can do a better job of it or we get patients that have\n disease that's in really tricky sites to treat like around the spinal cord but it doesn't matter what modality you have most of the world is not a proton therapy the point of this is you hit these things hard because you're going to benefit the individual you don't just tell them you know sorry Mr Smith you've got metastatic disease tough luck stay on hormone therapy and leave it at that I get asked this a lot about partial gland treatment you know because there are potentially some advantages to it let's treat part\n of the prostate right and you know you spare normal tissue you spare the neurovascular bundle you preserve erectile function much better you're not going to have as much of the rectum and bladder treated etc etc you know why do you want to treat the whole gland if there's only disease on one side I mean that all sounds great but there's some risk to it and the biggest risk for that we often underestimate the bulk of disease just based on our Imaging even with our fancy Imaging and even with random biopsies and Mr guided biopsy\n if you look at gentlemen who have surgery and you look at the percentage that have multi-focal disease it's pretty darn High which is why the standard approach is still to either you know you operate you take out the whole gland or if you radiate you tend to treat the whole gland there are a lot of ways to do partial gland treatment you know you just pretty much pick the way you want to do it if you're going to do it you can do cryo haifu nanoporation radiation etc etc it doesn't matter how you're doing\n it that the goal is still the same just to try to ablate that portion of it I can tell you that my personal clinical experience with this which is entirely anecdotal and based on a grand total of two patients is that doesn't work at least it hasn't worked the way I've done it what I've seen is that the patients I treated are kind of like the guys that come to me who've had other modalities that treat partial prostate they fail right at the edge of where you treat it so if they had cryo they fail at the\n edge of the cryo cavity the proton radiation they fail just past my high dose area now at the anecdotal and there you know you take it for what it's worth which may not be all that much remember I don't see the ones that don't fail right I only see the ones that have problem but because of the what I've seen in my personal experience I'm just not a big fan of it right now because I think that the risk of recurrence and letting disease sit there and potentially progress leaving to with that patient at risk for metastasis is a\n little bit too high you know I will do some quick examples of plans when we're doing our treatment and we're using our intensity modulated proton beams this again is prostate with the intraprostatic Boost and now you can see of course we're using the hydrogel which is markedly reduced rectal bleeding in fact it's down to around less than five percent of our patients versus 25 percent same patient again cut down the middle but you've got the dose of the prostate you're sparing the dose\n is to normal tissue this is a gentleman that's currently under treatment I'm treating his pelvic lymphatics oops we'll go back to that if I can there we go good wrong button that's the pelvic lymph nodes are up here he's got two bone Mets who are also treating at the same time one here one here so we're able to separate the dose to all those areas and get very clever with our our dose painting looking at him down the side or treating his lymph nodes we're not treating his intestines and we're doing a good job of\n boosting the radiate the dose in his prostate to the areas that have the greatest amount of disease this is a solitaryological metastatic site patient also just finished treatment had a pelvic lymph node getting treated up here high dose there and not giving anything up here post-operative patient a girl is also personal treatment right now we still use the balloon in them because it's hard to put the gel in but the goal is to treat the prostate bed boost it get rid of the disease that's there hopefully render that person disease\n free and again you can see him on a side picture future developments I mean I I'm gonna just touch on this really briefly because I think that it's it's kind of fun to talk about but at the same time it's it's this point of this meeting is more talk about prostate cancer the Bragg Peak is our biggest strength in proton therapy it's also our biggest challenge because we have to know where to put it right we've got this beautiful tool that comes to a stop but if you don't stop it in the right place you're\n not doing that person a favor and how do you know you're stopping in the right place well you know we've got all these different ways to to do that but they're all based upon physical assumptions so we'd like to have ways that we can measure this and you know and we're coming up with that I mean I'm going to go through these pretty quickly because I don't think I want to dig into the weeds but for example one of the things that we're experimenting with now and this is this is going in throughout the\n proton Community is doing things to change our delivery you know maybe deliver in an arc not delivered a static field perhaps we can look at ways to verify the radiation dose we're giving to the patient in real time using techniques called prompt gamma and some other stuff we're looking at better Computing systems to take the radiation biology the linear energy transfer into account and you know we're looking also at real-time image guidance improvements like you have an x-ray therapy the MRI guidance of X-ray therapy has gone from\n being something with under development to something which is now relatively commonly available people are doing the same thing in the proton world I think I'm going to stop at that point because I've got slides in this but they're more again the interest is it's not the same it just shows that like everything else we are improving what we're doing which is the job of medicine right I mean the goal of all this is to get to the point where none of us are ever sitting in this room again talking about this stuff\n that's what you want I don't know I don't want to get it you know that's that's where we're trying to go with this but proton therapy because of the fact that it's now more widely available and because the technology is getting less expensive like everything else in medicine and other Technologies we're able to develop it and improve it and we're doing the same improvements and trying to do the same advances that come straight out of the X-ray therapy World whether it's delivery Imaging Etc so\n that would give me more specific in what we do and hopefully be more beneficial to the people that we need to treat all right thank you very much appreciate your attention your time Dr Rossi fabulous I haven't seen you in a while same he did this meeting was it 2018-19 I think it was 2019 when you're over at Marina Del Rey we did one year we moved over to Marina del Rey to the Marriott and uh that was a great event too yeah so I actually remember your lecture and uh oh God somebody did I do I know it's good because I'm gonna I want to\n ask you a couple of things from that lecture that I couldn't ask you about four or five years ago I'm sure you remember what I'm talking about um I want to ask you a few things though but it has nothing to do with prostate cancer to begin with so I looked at your bio and uh here's what it said it said Dr Carl Rossi when he's not caring for patients or conducting research he enjoys running which I know because you and I are Avid Runners cycling which I know I don't cycle as much but that's\n okay traveling I know because you travel a lot and then here's the one that made me Double Take it said and flying yeah and I thought what's that mean commercially and then I thought I wonder how he got here today and how you get around so you mean you fly airplanes yeah I've been doing that for 35 years okay wow and you flew in this weather yeah yeah okay and you have a big insurance policy my mother so I'm impressed and the other thing it said that I never looked at is it said you treat prostate\n cancer and it said lymphoma can you just quickly cover that I just never knew the lymphoma part yeah so lymphomas are tumors of the lymphatic system and the most one that most people are familiar with is Hodgkin's Disease which is a it was actually a success story in cancer treatment that was a university fatal disease up to the late 1940s when the radiotherapy techniques were first developed to treat it and what's changed over the last 30 40 years again we learned the hard way is that there were a lot of people cured of\n Hodgkins in the 40s and 50s and 60s with radiation unfortunately 20 30 years later 15 years later they started dying of heart disease second cancers pulmonary fibrosis Etc so in oncology in on treatment of lymphomas the treatment has now gone to try to get the best of both worlds where you will do chemotherapy to attempt to eradicate the majority of the disease and that usually works really well on the microscopic stuff it doesn't work so well when you had a 10 or 12 centimeter mass in somebody's chest because the\n drugs never get there in the appropriate concentration so we will use radiation to consolidate the chemotherapy response and the reason that you do that I like to do that with protons and in kids or adults is sparing healthy tissue you want to minimize the chance of causing a problem because you're going to cure virtually all these patients so you know do you want to cure them and make them have a need a heart transplant 10 years later I had a radiologist attending at Loma Linda that was also a pilot and she had been treated for\n Hodgkin's Disease about 25 30 years earlier and she passed away not from a malignancy from that but she passed away from what's called pulmonary fibrosis in essence her lungs just became scarred it was no way to stop it and it was every bit as terrible as any cancer you'd ever see so that's why we treat lymphoma with protons Loma Linda I did a lot of pediatric lymphoma here in San Diego I do primarily adults because we have somebody else that does the Pediatrics okay it also said on the website more than 13 000 prostate\n cancer patients have been treated with protons over the last 31 years more than any other place in the world no I mean I got stuck doing this fortuitously I just happened to do my residency in radiation oncology at Loma Linda when they were building the proton Center and they had we treated our first prostate patient his first day of treatment with one of my guys was October 8 1991.\n the second guy we ever treated was the physicist who designed our machine by the way anyway yeah oh yeah who lived to 102 passed away from other things but I mean I just happened to be there when it all started and my attending Dr James said to the picture I showed you about six months into this we were getting busy said well you know we're kind of busy do you want to stick around for a couple of years and maybe help out and that was 1992-ish and a couple years became 20 plus 25.\n so look I I don't have a skin in the game so yeah that's the fun part about my job yeah so then why am I going to other places that are popping up that are proton centers when this place has treated so many people with the same individual so I always find it interesting how when it comes to surgeons everyone says well you have to have the surgeon that does the most surgeries and now we're evolving in prostate cancer to say well you want to go to the person who does the most second reads on pathology like like so now we've now we're accustomed but you\n know my argument is why are we giving the other people a free pass like I told shernan I want the number one person who's reading psma scans I don't want number two I don't want the silver medal so with all these proton centers coming up I appreciate that but there's a learning curve yep so boy this is not putting you on the spot since it's going on YouTube but why tell me the state of those and why I would actually consider them and do you in your mind rank the centers that have experience or do\n you ever help with that besides your own so you know needless to say you have to have more than one person or one group that can do this or I like never leave the building and probably never sleep right it's just from a practical standpoint other people have to be able to do the work and what's happened over the last uh starting early 2000s actually is that you've had these other centers open many of whom like when we were little as to Loma Linda we had the MD Anderson doctors spend several months\n with us this is how we treat prostate cancer and we had folks from mayo and we had folks from Mass General that spent time there but over the last decade and a half there are now so many centers at what I would consider to be centers of excellence you know MGH Mayo et cetera that have their own institutional experience and their own training programs that I think that they are entirely competent to do the same thing I've been doing and when you look at the data that's published that's why I showed data from other institutions\n those numbers are as good as that Anderson data is as good as anything else I've seen that I've been able to generate yeah but how many years should a center be up and running before I feel like I want to be the next guinea pig sure so it's going to depend upon how they set their program up so if you're you know MD Anderson for example when they started we had several of their attending spend time with us and we were proctoring their cases like you do with the new surgical procedure I think that if a facility has done I'd\n say 200 cases in a year's time that they're going to be pretty proficient at it you're feeling better about that with 200 okay no I appreciate you giving me a number yeah so now what's the deal with there's a take on the internet with because you know the internet's always right of course so there's a take in the internet with insurance coverage and protons where are we with that is that still is that still controversial or can you just clear up the controversy yeah so it's been it's I'd say it is\n slowly improving over the the like maybe a half decade at a time so if you look at the history of proton therapy going back you know all the way back even you know back to the 50s 60s it was originally paid for by many insurers because these were patients of Last Resort they had no other choice in 1991 actually in February of 1991 so before we treated our first prostate patient Loma Linda Medicare actually CMS which is medicare's parent agency made a decision based upon that in part that work that was done at Mass General to start\n covering proton therapy of cancer not just prostate but everything and they've maintained that to this day and the difference in the cost to Medicare is the difference in the cost of the treatment delivery there's no difference on the professional side if I treat what protons or x-rays it's the same professional fee but protons because the technology complexity costs more they've been supporting that they've made it quite clear in meetings I've had with them in the last couple years that at\n some point when that technology no longer needs to support that difference is going to go away but that's been a consistent position that Medicare is at private insurance is all over the darn map and that's where you have more issues now you know kids everybody treats oh yeah it's a 18 year old go ahead go for it but I've had to fight for 22 year olds because that's oh they're an adult now like well you know what happened on their 22nd birthday they became miraculously radiation resistant the biggest difference and\n where we're seeing the insurers change is not surprisingly it's in the cost of delivery to the insurance carrier if you can get the treatment to the point where insurer X is writing the same check they don't care at that point and and we have contracts with a couple of insurers in California that's exact for prostate well that's exactly what it is they pay the same cost whether it's you know same case rate for imrt or protons and that's what they want because you talk to people about\n unfortunately you know and this is a a really rude wake-up call when you're you know kind of a Starry Eyed oncologist you go talk to insurance medical directors but hey look you know I'm reducing second cancers well I'm reducing other things great and they look at you and say well that's important but we really don't care if it's beyond a year and this is a competition I would in particularly newcomer from United Health several years ago I said what do you mean a year oh we have turnover we lose 50 of our\n patients in five years so it's not on our books great so the biggest reason that protons are becoming more widely accepted by the insurers it's not because of data we like to think it is it isn't it's two reasons number one is the cost of the treatment is lower and the other is that there have been a significant number of patients that have taken their insurer to court and won for various malignancies that were not treated with protons and that has gotten their attention so it's a long-term\n project and I I don't think I'll see the end of it the part B of my previous question was if you're ever comparing notes with other proton centers are you seeing are you seeing cure rates and toxicity differences between yours and others and again this is I know a delicate situation in but I gotta think there's some compare and contrast going on because I I'm I'll tell you what made me think of this question before I came here I was driving from up North Michigan and I was coming down there and\n there's a massive sign that said we have protons now and I'm going man okay this thing's everywhere so I wonder how competent this is you know so and I wonder about their toxicity rates are so that's your question sure in toxicity sure so we actually have a collaborative group called PCG proton collaborative group that virtually all proton centers including McLaren is a member of okay and we do publish and we we have a number of registry like there's a registry for prostate patients and stuff\n and we look at this in a perspective fashion to see if we're detecting any differences in toxicity between facilities for the modern centers that have been treating with especially with scanning Beams I haven't seen it but I can tell you that back in the you know earlier days like when was this Loma Linda and Mass General yeah oh yeah we had a randomized trial that we did and even though 70 of the patients were treated at Loma Linda and only 30 percent of MGH the toxicity at MGH was substantially higher not because there were a bunch of\n doofuses but because they didn't have the ability to treat with a bean that went through the hips they had the treat through the perineum so they were treating more rectum that and they also kind of screwed up their calculation in their proton dose they used a method that gave them about a five percent higher dose than they thought they were giving and that all came out in the wash but if I look around now at you know the center where what are the center I mean a lot of centers of excellence you've got you know UPenn now has three proton\n facilities no problem at all three patients being treated out seeing differences I haven't seen any at Mayo um although I've had a discussion with Mayo Scottsdale where they've said that in their post-operative patients they've seen some toxicities that I haven't seen I can't explain it but across the board it looks very very very similar and if you look at the the PCG data we're looking at thousands of these patients we're not seeing any any you know red flags at this place is bad or there's\n some unusual toxicity so if we switch that topic for a second you know what's all the rage lately and we had a meeting not too long ago as this sbrt and you know I'm sorry it is attractive if you're going to tell me I can be treated in five treatments and then I'm done this is coming back over and over again and the toxicity may be the same and I'm done in five days and look this is taken off in other cancers so my question is um are you doing anything similar in the proton world like a proton therapy sbrt\n because that's big time competition baby oh yeah well do we use proton sbrt in cans first of all in cancer the answer is absolutely in fact that's one of the ways that we treat liver Mets and we and all of those oligom metastatic sites that I treat are three to five fraction sbrt now you want to know about primary intact prostate I want to know about primary prostate cancer so can you give me five days and be done I can't wait let me tell you what will happen in my experience so if I do that because I've done it I've done it back\n and back way back in 2019 if it remembers that far back I had 41 gentlemen that were favorable some unfavorable intermediate risk that I treated with five fraction proton sbrt 8 gray times five same if you do with x-rays and that was done over in the space of a week and I've been following them and here's the good news and here's not so good news the good news is there are biochemical freedom from relapse is every bit as good as what I see if I do this when I used to do it over nine weeks and now I do it over five and a\n half no difference the not so good news was that 20 to 25 percent of them had persistent urinary bother that lasted for the better part of a year and that required Medrol dose packs and other things to knock it down and I don't see that when I go more slowly now if you look at the sbrt literature with x-rays you're going to find some places say that happens some say it doesn't so it's a little bit up in the air the current national recommendations the current nccn guidelines for radiation say you can do\n this in one week you can do it in eight weeks our preferred regimen based on the long-term data that we have is four to six weeks so I haven't been doing I had you know because of what I saw with the urination the toxicity I'm not routinely offering it because I just didn't feel like I saved you you know four weeks and I gave you six months of misery that's a bad trade-off yeah in a quarter of those patients so a friend of mine who went to see you was surprised how long it took when you just have to come in every day\n what's the average treatment time when you when you come in for proton therapy and then how much time how much of the day are you taking up I tell a gentleman plan on being in the building an hour a day up on the treatment days which is five days a week that hour you're gonna probably spend about 45 minutes doing what you always do in medical office and that's twiddle in your thumbs and hopefully finding a more you know recent magazine to read or getting on our wireless network having some fun you spend about 15 10 to\n 15 minutes of the hour in the treatment area and about 15 to 15 minutes you're going to spend between 30 to 60 seconds being treated everything else is positioning so everyone we treat whether it's you know whatever our part of the body they're on they're in some kind of customized immobilization device and they're on a robotic table which has six degrees of freedom so the majority of the time they're that they're in the room we've got them in the treatment area there's Imaging equipment built\n into the frame of the Gantry and we're doing volumetric Imaging just like you do in x-ray therapy to adjust their position so that the daily position matches the plan position so yeah it's a lot of waiting around and your the actual treatment is very brief but then after that you get out and do whatever you want what do you tell patients about hormone therapy in terms of in general like a sweeping generalization of who you favor and who you don't favor to receive hormone therapy when they get protons so it's the same rules in\n protons with hormone therapy as you have an x-ray therapy there's no again there's no difference so who do we tend to use this on on favorable intermediate risk high and very high risk and of course it's the same duration so once you get that unfavorable intermediate and high yeah yeah same thing no different as far as what I tell them you know I I think that I think the medical oncologist and the radiation oncologists do a much better job of telling people what's actually going to happen when they're on ADT\n versus the urologist that's just my impression but it's telling people look you're going to feel it you know by and large you're doing this because it's going to give you a better result down the road but you're going to be suffering for a while and you just have to you know there are ways to mitigate that you have to accept it or you know I'd say a third of the gentlemen that I have this discussion with who meet all the criteria for hormone therapy whether it's short-term or long-term they say I\n understand why you're recommending it I don't want to do it and my response to them is all right it's an adult decision you know it's something we've talked about after you've had a chance to to make an informed decision if that's your that's your you know the way that you want to be I understand you're giving you're giving up this in terms of control but it's your decision and I still treat no I want to go but I want to spend the last portion on before I get to this the last portion is going to be an\n oligom metastatic disease okay this is this is a pretty hot area and I've seen doctors go to you and you hit a couple spots and you know yeah the whole game of treating oligomyesthetic disease is amazing if we ultimately find that it is works right but it seems to be working yeah okay so I'm going to table that and talk about my favorite subject which is the catches of radiation therapy and I just want to go through some rules and you just tell me what you say so a lot of patients come in and I asked you this when you were\n here many years ago by the way you probably don't remember the joke I told you when you first came in five six years ago you laughed really hard so I told the joke that I said a neutron walks in a bar and says to the bartender Neutron not a proton this is for the Geeks in the audience I said the neutron said how much for a beer and the bartender said for you no charge um you see you can tell you're older you laughed you thought that was funny when you were younger anyway so a lot of patients in California they like to take\n supplements just like the mission oh yeah right this is a big deal and you know what I'm sorry to say but I I am not happy with the way radiation oncology and oncologists have handled the idea they need an answer and I know they come to me for this answer but they need an answer from you all okay if I'm taking a handful of supplements and I'm coming to get proton therapy of any kind even I'll go metastatic disease one of the camps say all right what you're doing is you're preventing free radicals\n from being generated by the radiation so you are limiting the effect of radiation another Camp says it makes no difference radiation is so much more energy why are you worrying about it I don't give a damn and then there are some I bumped into that says take all that stuff because it's going to help the radiation yeah what do you say to all the people it's like I'm a fan of supplements but what do you say to the supplement takers during the radiation course yeah I tell them part of this is based on a\n discussion I've had with you on more than one occasion where you've sold me and I tend to believe it that we create so many free radicals that it doesn't probably doesn't make a difference but I tell them though is look we have data from a head and neck cancer radiotherapy study not prostate other end of the body where patients were being given effectively a prescription strength antioxidant because the idea was this could prevent them from getting other cancers in the upper ear digestive tract\n sorry and in those patients it looked like the radiation was slightly less effective at controlling their primary tumor whole different situation than what you'll be able to take you know what you get the health food store that said if you want to be you know as conservative as you possibly can stop taking the supplements during the treatment you can resume the day you're done because the free radicals that we create when we radiate that's what breaks the DNA by the way is it's an indirect effect they'll ask for about 10\n to the minus 4 seconds after the beam shuts off every day so you know but that's what I tell them it probably doesn't make a difference but if you want to be you know Ultra Conservative then just eliminate anything which is a free radical scavenger during treatment well that's helpful and then what about diet wise is it okay to get a lot of fiber in my diet when I'm going through radiation because what they say during some Imaging and some of the radiation processes is if you create too much\n intestinal or rectal gas you can make the but you can you can make the prostate move more than as usual but I'm just saying do you guys do you even worry about the diet side of it in terms of interfering very little if we have somebody first of all we're you know we're looking at these patients every day in three dimensions right before we treat them so it's we get a volumetric picture of where they're at and that includes looking at bowel gas so we have the occasional patient where we'll look\n at the image and say boy they got a lot of gas and then we'll tell them yeah you should probably add less gas you'll be more comfortable but it but we're able to adjust the patient's position in near real time to adjust to take into account anything that may have moved because they had you know more stool less stool Etc okay so someone just decides they want to go plant-based during the radiation procedure and they get all sorts of fiber you don't lose any sleep I generally don't okay what about\n repurposed drugs it's one of my favorite categories I'm going to end up talking about with Dr souls in the next session the repurposed drugs is the concept that very simple drugs that exist over the counter a prescription that many of you may be taking may have a secondary benefit in fighting cancer and we didn't realize it until time went on and we did more research the one that I see the most about radiation and I've seen in a lot of the radiation papers the suggestion is cholesterol lowering\n medication may increase the radio sensitivity or the ability to kill the tumor during radiation but no one's ever tested it this has all been retrospective data so is it possible that if I take my cholesterol lowering drug while you treat me with protons I may get a better outcome or what how do you what's your stance on that I think it's possible that it's pretty tenuous is by the way I would reply that question I just like metformin's another drug I think is beneficial yes right even that one that one's this in clear\n benefits but not because it's synergistic with radiation it's beneficial for other reasons yes so we you know it gets back to what I was saying earlier about how we understand our physics to this really well but the biology of it's still a big black box and ideally what you'd like to have is drug treatments that would enhance the biologic effects of radiotherapy in one way of shape or form repeatably and that still doesn't exist but you have no problem I mean you have no problem with them taking those meds I\n don't know and a very significant percentage of patients are taking them anyway because of other medical issues okay so what you said in the last conference which this was the one that stunned me about side effects because I had never heard of radiation I don't I don't know if you'll remember it because but you said I said well what happens after radiation or during radiation you know what are some of the issues you deal with and you talked about urgency and things like that I said well do you\n recommend anything and at the time I think you used the words azomax which is benazzo paradine you've actually brought that up I don't know if you remember because you're the only person who's ever brought it up since so can you explain that and if you still are an advocate of buying that over over-the-counter product or getting it as a prescription it's a it's a urinary analgesic basically but I know are you still a fan of taking that I am but it's not the first thing I reach for anymore\n so you know the first of all having urinary frequency and urgency during treatment is very common and that's that's the one in fact it's usually the only side effect I hear about from the patients they don't get diarrhea their blood counts don't crash they're not getting nauseated et cetera et cetera but they're PMR so you tell them you know first of all what kind of liquids are you drinking because that can make a difference oh I've been drinking my smoothies Every Day Made of you know 20\n different types of fruit juice that have they're all have citric acid and well maybe you should cut that out for now that can help so that's that's number one number one number two NSAIDs the vast majority of these gentlemen if you start telling them I want you to take a leave twice a day you know consistently with some food you're going to knock this down it's going to keep it under control not the I tried it it didn't work meaning I tried it once and nothing happened so if they're having urgency\n I'll have them do a leave or Advil I probably have had in the last six months only one or two patients that I've ended up giving peridium to because for most of them the NSAIDs and controlling the type of liquids that they drink makes the difference no that's important so ibuprofen so naproxen Aleve Motrin they take it when they have the urgency yeah and but what if they have the urgency for a long time are you worried that that might increase their bleeding risk or it just it it's well with the exception of the\n guys I treated with this stereotactic technique that usually doesn't persist for very long but the other thing I've done you know you always ratchet you start from simple and go to more complex if the if the over-the-counter NSAIDs aren't doing it then you got a couple of choices one is to switch to prescription and say like Celebrex which may reduce the stomach upset but I've also had a lot of success by giving patients a netheral dose pack so can you explain what a Medrol dose pack is it's basically it sounds pretty\n sounds pretty cool doesn't it it's it's a steroid dose pack it's used a lot for a lot of conditions and we love using stories of medicine because they seem to work in almost everything so in essence what you do is you have a prescription and you go to the pharmacy and they give you this package that says take you know four of these day one or six of these day one then you step it down a day at one pill each day it's the intent is it's a pulse of steroids which are anti-inflammatory medications and that\n can you know my experience can do wonders in terms of reducing the urinary symptoms what you often have to do during treatment if someone's having trouble you know you want to break that cycle because if you don't they're going to be miserable but if you can do something just to get it under control then after that's under control you can back off and now maybe taking ibuprofen you know what once or twice a day can help you so that's the short term that's the bothersome stuff the urgency that's\n the short term during the process a little bit after the process right yeah okay long term yeah oh man oh man yeah man oh man I'm serious like two three years after protons or something still have a little bit of rectal bleeding and so this leads to my bigger question which is still no one I still have not figured this out if someone has chronic problems from radiation God forbid yeah where do they go first of all because you know it's not I mean we have some reconstructive urologists with not many but where do you go where do they go and\n second of all when they experience some of these kind of symptoms and sometimes they're mild but they're they're persistent in their pain and what what do you talk about with them so the first thing of course I try to do is get a a good detailed picture of what they're experiencing and try to figure out if there are any other extraneous factors that are making it worse but you're absolutely right a lot a lot of gentlemen after radiotherapy you know they're going to have issues with frequency and urgency that can come on\n three to five years later so in terms of how to treat that again I like to work from simple to more complex and what I have found has been very beneficial both for the rectal bleeding which by the way is much less common now with the hydrogel and also for the urinary issues is Hyperbaric therapy oh yeah thank you oh yeah I didn't even I met him in the green room we didn't talk about what his answers this is in my mind it's a basketball but I didn't know how you're gonna answer it but I I I can't tell the audience enough yeah\n look hyperbaric oxygen therapy or h-bot I've written about a lot and there's so many men who don't understand it's an option when they have those ones so many doctors that don't understand I have talked to so many people have undergone protons they've undergone every type of therapy and then they suddenly walk in their local hospital they say yeah you're approved we'll cover all of your hyperbaric oxygen therapy treatments and yeah you have to sit in a chamber and watch TV every day\n and come back but so many of these men come back and say my bleeding what I always hear is my bleeding's a little bit less or it's gone because they get inflammation there that's helped so yeah so you've seen that too oh all the time we're we're lucky at UC San Diego and that probably because it's a big diving medicine program we've got a very strong Hyperbaric medicine program in the and the urologists also are used to working with the Hyperbaric therapy doctors because for a lot of insurers to improve\n Hyperbaric therapy for say cystitis you have to have a documentary documented gnosis so they have to go get a cystoscopy look inside there oh yeah look you've got surprise surprise cystitis and they send him for the chambers and you know you typically after 35 40 Dives people really feel better yeah it's simple so you go in for a lot of treatments it could take an hour or two it's a high pressure chamber but now they have them where you can sit with 10 other people they're large and you just relax and the idea is it\n enhances the the wound healing process we know it's not making things worse so it's either making it better or the same yeah and that's not a bad deal when you're dealing with a chronic radiation problem right so we've tried to get the word out on that I'm I didn't even know that you were gonna say that okay then what about um what about someone that has IBS or they have other bowel issues they have ulcerative colitis they just have a ton of bowel issues but they need to get radiation therapy how do you deal with\n that so the conditions that Mark is mentioning are ones where we at least with x-ray therapy you try to shy away from them because they are very poorly tolerated so in fact if you look at some of the you know like Astro or professional societies recommendations for proton therapy one of those is in patients who have ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease because you know the easiest way to not hurt them is you stop the beam before it gets there so if it's Crohn's and it's in the small bowel I can treat that any\n day because I can stop the beam before it ever hits a small bowel ulcerative colitis can be a little trickier because it depends upon where it is in the large bowel so what I do with those gentlemen is tell them first thing you need to know is is it active and if so where is it active so you got to talk to their GI doctor and they have to have a colonoscopy and if somebody comes in and says I've got active like you see in the rectum then it's all right this is a really good reason to make sure we get the biggest spacer that\n we possibly can into that to move the rectum out of the way you still tell them it's a higher risk because of the of the underlying ulcerative colitis but the whatever you can do to reduce the radiation doses to their benefits are you're still a fan of hydrogel I am so can you explain to the audience what this is because I still notice that a lot of people in the audience and around the country and globally will go into their doctor and then they'll just get radiation and there was there wasn't a\n discussion of there wasn't a discussion of what should I get it or not right yeah so can you talk about this this gel that goes between that's injected that goes between the prostate and the rectum that's supposed to reduce toxicity doesn't that sound delightful I mean yeah no no remember it was just a theory a few years theory that was tested in a randomized trial that's that's the point that a lot of a lot of radiation oncologists don't seem to want to acknowledge but I let me just interrupt\n you I just read a paper a major journal about using another type of hydrogel with hyaluronic acids so obviously I'm saying this is picking up right oh yeah everybody wants a piece of this action so you're a fan of it yeah tell me who gets it who doesn't get it okay so first of all what is it yeah so this is a water-soluble gel that you place through the skin not through the rectum but you go in the skin between the front of the rectum and the back of the scrotum under local anesthesia you inject this gel which\n goes into this what becomes a space between the back of the prostate and the front of the rectum the way that we're normally put together or those two structures are right next to each other they're a millimeter apart so if you're trying to give a high radiation dose to the prostate especially if you want to get fancy in boost areas you're limited by the dose the rectum will tolerate this material generally create it varies with the person and you don't look like you'd expect but in general you create\n about a 1.3 to 1.5 centimeter gap between the prostate and the rectum in the proton world that's a 70 decrease in radiation dose to that anterior rectal wall so what I have seen clinically and what was reported in the randomized trial when they did this with x-rays was that back in the day when I used to treat everybody with a rectal balloon I would tell them patients 20 to 25 percent of you are going to be calling me nine months to a year after you finish saying you see blood in your bowel movements and I'll tell you it's\n going to go away keep your bowel movement soft et cetera et cetera but it's annoying that number is now about three percent because you've reduced the radiation dose that much so who gets that um yeah I have to have a good reason not to do it it's usually a person who refuses it the other patients where we don't do it is if it looks like on Imaging they've got disease in that area because there are concerns that if you put something in there and you're moving those two structures apart you could be\n moving the cancer cells posteriorly and moving them into the lower dose radiation area so I try to do this on everyone we're doing definitive prostate treatment we've done it on a number of post-operative patients especially those who have been radiated previously but we're able to get the gel in there and again push the rectum and the prostate apart and I've done this in patients who had prior prostate radiation and we're going to retreat and so you used it because of data but now several years\n later you're saying you believe the data you're happy you're happy with it so you'll continue to use it my phone doesn't ring seriously we this was so that's good to know yeah so my last questions are do you ever give protons after protons meaning you ever you ever re-radiate someone do we ever rear radiate well yeah we do in fact this is another area where there's a and I'll tell you let me tell you why I threw you a softball question okay I was really nice to you on this one well thanks I'm\n still concerned about the flying thing oh no but the reason I said this is because I've always argued that you guys don't have a good sales pitch in urology you can say Hey you know if I take the prostate out you can always get radiation but if I radiate you up front you can't get surgery right and I know there's some exceptions but this part that's there's a lot of Truth to that but I'm saying you've never had a counter argument and part of the counter argument is there are people that can be radiated after\n radiation I do have a community this is you're right this comes up all the time and I do have a counter argument so what I tell the patients is that if you have a recurrence after radiation therapy after primary radiation you've got about half a dozen different ways to address that it's not and rear radiation is one of them okay what I tend to favor because from what I've seen I think it's the safest way to do it is focal cryo surgery freeze the area where the recurrence is because it's more controllable than\n doing rear radiation the concern with rearradiation and this gets to you know our unknowns is that even though that normal tissue may not have been clinically damaged the first time you treated it you create some microscopic injury that may or may not be repaired and we're so we're now just learning more about how much of that actually is repaired as time goes by so historically if you rearradiate the concern has been you're going to place patients at a high risk for complications like a fistula of the\n rectum so personal experience I've rear radiated patients at Loma Linda I re-radiated patients in San Diego at Loma Linda I retreated 16 gentlemen who were all patients I had initially treated with protons and they had a recurrence and we treated them this was with you know long before we had balloons passive scattered beams big margins Etc the good news was that in 15 the 16 their PSAs went I mean they lead dropped like post-op and they stayed there one of them was the second guy we ever treated that gentleman designed our\n accelerator he did find the rest of his life the not so good news in that group was that because I was retreating a pretty hefty chunk of the rectum and because I wasn't pulling my punch if I gave Mr Smith 70 gray the first time and it didn't work giving him another 30 doesn't make any sense we went after it that 25 percent of them wound up with what we would call as you know grade four complication they needed temporary colostomy not so good the one I presented that data national meeting got people telling me that's really not bad\n because there are other options like surgery are not better well you know great it's gotten to be much better now because of better delivery and excluding if you can the rectum away but re-treatment rear radiation is still not my first choice because I think from what I've seen at least with protons yeah but what I've seen I think that cryo is a safer technique I also like for the rear radiation patients I think that HDR high dose rate after loading is an excellent way to do it because you have more control over where the dose\n goes so I've had patients come up with Dr Chang you're at UCLA to get retreated yeah well so that's that's good to know um will you explain to me what happens let's say my prostate's a little large and I get proton therapy I get radiation what happens with the size of the prostate will you please will you please enlighten us because some people a lot of people don't realize what happens to the actual prostate let's say I've got a large product it triples in size so no but but you know this is not\n common knowledge no I know but so if you have a slightly enlarged prostate like most men do as we get older yep right it's weird everything gets everything shrinks as we get older but the prostate gets bigger so that's kind of a bad God joke or something I don't know but okay but what happens you radiate it then what happens to the size of the problem so on average you lose about 30 to 40 percent of the prostate volume after radiotherapy over over a span of one to two years because what you know we're\n giving these Doses and yeah you're a little more likely to kill the cancer cells but these are ablative doses you're destroying the glandular tissue and as those cells attempt to grow and divide they die yeah so what that means is that in about roughly 70 to 75 percent of the gentlemen who have gone through radiation if you ask them to fill out a ipss score yes it's better yes but in the other 25 it could be worse because as the gland has shrunk now there's more pressure on the yeah if they also receive hormonal therapy as a\n component of their care the volume loss is substantially greater because you get a volume loss from the hormone treatment as well as from the radiation yeah so the you know you're more you're more likely than not if you go through radiotherapy to have an improvement in urinary symptoms down the road yeah long term yeah long term no I'm glad you explained that they never explained that in school so it's and it's important for the patient to understand suddenly they get their prostate measured again and it's a third\n Less in terms of volume and it's not a bad thing no no it's a good thing all right last question we call it a day oligomatostatic prostate cancer so we talked about treating the primary area but let's say I got a couple spots here people are going in and getting those couple spots Zapped and the reason they're doing that is because they're in the hopes that they don't have to go through a lot of drug treatments they're just zapping those one or two spots will control the tumor or get rid of it\n enough that they'll never have to go on any sort of hormone therapy and you've treated a number of these patients yeah including doctors which just it had good results but tell us where you are with oligom metastatic prostate cancer how many spots do you treat I mean you look for three or four do they have to be in the same neighborhood and how many treatments just spend it with that sure so in it's as you can imagine you got individualized because having five spots you know scattered throughout the body\n may be different than five spots in the pelvis and five spots showed up in a month and their PSA is going up in Leaps and Bounds that's a different situation than the PSA Rising slowly so I am a strong proponent of oligom metastatic treatment because I think the data supports it as I showed you some of that earlier I look at five or less and my tendency when I treat these is to treat the areas in five three to five fractions so many three to five times it's like I want that one slide I showed of the rib\n that's that's the three fraction treatment three days of treatment and I tell the gentleman going into this look the the we we're doing this you know the hope is exactly as you said we're going to cure you we're going to cure you and you will get that in a um frustrating minority of patients maybe 20 if you're lucky that's what you see the most the most likely benefit is just what they mentioned and what they found in the extend trial we didn't cure you but you know what we've given you a nice\n holiday from ADT yeah and you feel better and we apparently are slowing down the next wave of metastasis so clinically you're fine so that's a you know that's a win-win too so what do you consider a response if so you hit something like for example a friend of mine you you did that too he had he had one spot and he was point one something and now he's 0.\n 04 you know that's more than 50 yeah do you consider that that's a response more than 50 psh yeah I'm even happy if the PSA is just stable yeah because again you're you're doing this because you're trying to keep them off of medications so if yeah if your PSA is at one it's staying at one and you know it makes you wonder sometimes maybe and I get curious and I'll reimage just in case there's a cloneogen that's not making PSA but you know if your PSA is stable and in the past your PSA always went up when you had progression\n we'll leave you alone fabulous we went over and I apologize but you made a lot of effort flying here right you didn't do commercial flights so I we wanted to keep you longer it's important so we have to make sure you go back with some heartfelt gifts and the first one is a new coffee mug for you right all right and I don't know many radiation oncologists that have a mug like this it says think like a proton and stay positive there you go right and I and I that is really sweet my first thought is\n he's got a hundred of them I don't no I don't no I don't where's the imagination of these people who give you gifts no I anyway so it was a very positive talk you're a very positive guy but then I thought let's go further because you've always been dedicated to pcri getting good information out so let's let's find something that might be even more near and dear to his heart and when you take it out can you explain to the audience what this means okay it's not a puppy\n so can you believe that I don't believe that so what this is of course it's clear so you can't see it this is a glass that wine glass which says Claremont McKenna College which is the college where I went to as an undergrad and have just a fantastic time there and I was lucky enough to be able to compete in division three track and field and cross-country of my entire time there and still help out there as an assistant thank you you have any glasses from Euro college or alma mater no I have some\n coffee cups I don't have one of these you don't have that that is New Classic alumni glass it's really hard you get stuff from them I don't know well the coffee cups I'm not supposed to have I think that they kind of found their way out of the dining hall don't tell anyone no that's okay so there you go that's great thank you [Music] thank you Dr Rossi and thank you Dr Moya that was very informative I just want to take a quick minute to thank bear Pfizer dendrion estellas Jansen in my event for\n helping us put on this event thanks to them it's a hundred percent free for all of you also please remember take this link of this conference and share it in prostate cancer Forums on Facebook on your social media and help get the word out we want to give this free education to as many people as possible we want them to know their options we want them to think about their quality of life and be aware of the side effects so that they can make informed decisions and have shared decision making in those medical offices\n with their Physicians our next session is one of my favorites it's with our executive director Dr Mark scholes and with our beloved moderator Dr Mark moyad the great thing about them is it's Mark and Mark it's the different perspectives on prostate cancer Dr Mark Schultz is a medical oncologist in private practice and Dr Mark moyad is in the Urologic division of the University of Michigan in Academia it's so interesting hearing their differing perspectives on what they agree with and what they don't\n agree with but the reason we present this to you is we want you to have all the information from different perspectives the questions that they're answering have been previously submitted for this conference but if you have questions during the session our helpline is still on and you can go ahead and ask your questions in the chat function on our YouTube channel or email us at info pcri.\n org without further Ado here's Dr Mark scholes and here is Dr Mark moyad all right um before we start here's my gift to you Dr scholes wears the most bizarre ties I've ever seen and so I bought one but I thought and my gift to him should be a clip-on he's always in a hurry so here's my clip-on tie so feel free to put on a clip on it it's gonna be nice the staff helped me get it not bad yeah it's beautiful yeah and like when I was in Catholic school I had to clip it on well make it a boutonniere hand so there we\n go all right so here's how we normally do this we go really really fast then hang out for a little bit afterward but what we first do is Dr Scholl's it goes through his thoughts of the talks pros and cons I might throw in some stuff and then we just go through all the questions from the audience and other points and then we get through probably 70 80 things and within an hour I'm ready when you are go yeah so our first talk was about Advanced prostate cancer but I was so impressed by the um the strong message of advocacy\n that I'd never really heard articulated so well that uh in this era of rapidly changing technology that you're going to confront situations where you know more about your situation than your doctor does and that's pretty disappointing but it's a reality and it's the good news is it's uh there is it's a result of amazing advances in technology just incredible advances so you're going to run into that and one of our board members Steve Schwartz has a video which you see I think it's had close to a hundred\n thousand visits already and his Mantra he's a he's a contractor is question your experts question your experts so you want to surround yourself with experts you as Dr Heath told us we we want to have a team that surround us and we want to then utilize that team and question your experts I think that was what I got out of Dr Heath's talk and thank you so much Dr Moyet even we we were wondering if this is just like a thing with Dr Heath I mean both of them coming from Michigan and whatnot but I was pleasantly surprised I actually\n actually stunned I thought it was one of the best talks that we've had on Advanced prostate cancer her strength I thought was the ability to see it from a patient point of view yeah and a lot of our experts are very academic they have a lot of slides with a lot of graphs on them and it's impressive and it's interesting but getting right down to the Grassroots of you all being advocates questioning your experts and taking responsibility so I love that about her talk I don't know if you had any further\n comments I hadn't seen her in a while she's she's like me she's she's social when she's here but she's very quiet to herself when she's not and likes her private time so I hadn't talked to her in a little while but the first thing she said to me before she went on stage was she said she's overwhelmed when she walks to the parking lot of oncologists and urologists and always people running up to her going what's the latest with genetic testing what because she said\n the fields become so overwhelming that unless the patients participate which is exactly what you're saying unless they really engage they could be missing out because just their doctors trying to keep up is overwhelming and I just have to tell you I I do feel sorry for the Physicians because you know in a lot of situations academics are not they're being told by certain people that they need to see more people in a day more and more and so they're developing their computer side manner not their bedside\n Manner and they're moving from room to room and they're being pushed by a slightly higher power to see more volume more volume and so something has to give and what gives is more self-education time I think it's that it's going to continue to suffer based on the system that we're in but if you understand why the system is the way it is then I see more people get involved in their own education so we do something very smart here for 15 years we just don't pick speakers they've been heavily vetted whether I've\n seen her probably 18 different times most of the speakers that have ever come here they don't realize that many of them were unknowns in the patient World until they came here but these were people we saw time and time again deliver Flawless wonderful talks and they were very educated they are very passionate and I can I can count on one hand in 15 years a really bad speaker that we probably would never invite back but we've seen them time and time again do their thing in front of doctors and then it's funny just so you know for Dr\n souls and I 15 years ago we would beg people to come to this meeting to speak now everybody gives us their CV they all want to speak here so the whole game has changed that's the answer to he's think yeah one thing so accolades to her really impressive amazing but the uh she did talk a little bit about genetics and there was one little practical tidbit I thought was interesting is the the genetics companies apparently these are the people that will take your blood or or do a mouth swab and tell you if\n you're going to be eligible for some of these medications or if you're at higher risk for some a more aggressive cancers and apparently they're being funded generously by Medicare because these companies will actually come to your home and draw your blood if you talk to your doctor and say I want an invite blood test or or a garden 360 blood test or a foundation one these are the companies maybe I'm not as reticent as Dr Heath is about giving commercial names then your doctor all you have to\n do is write an order and they'll come out draw your blood and run the genetic test I don't blanket tell early stage patients to do genetic tests although I'm certainly not against it there is some evidence that maybe people with brca mutations are a little more likely to progress if they have early stage disease but it's not a game changer in my mind it is for some Physicians but the for the advanced patients it's really irresponsible not to have genetic testing if you're Advanced so it's very easy to do and the\n just ask your doctor and whether he draws the blood while you're in the office visiting them there or send someone out to your house to get your blood it's really easy to get a lot of us live in a world where family histories are sketchy oh grandpa had this I think he had died of that or and so when in doubt you know it's interesting how many people go get their uh germline they call it analysis and they end up having one of these mutations it's striking so one of the most frustrating things I deal with is\n someone's will say you know I don't think I had prostate cancer from the family I mean grandpa had this and this and that but I'm not sure what they died of and lo and behold they get tested and there's the mutation I mean it's really tough to go back on records I mean my grandfathers extended family I still and I'm not sure what happened to them and I did a lot of investigating and so when in doubt I think it's an incredibly amazing option that I wish more people would explore right\n all right so uh what about uh do you want to say anything about the other speakers yeah so well let's do uh Dr Rossi since we just heard from him the uh subject of focal therapy came up in his talk he yeah he uh he humbly kind of bowed out he said I've treated two patients I didn't wasn't thrilled with the results but I think focal therapy has um a bright future honestly and he mentioned that he did Salvage cryotherapy in one of his patients that's a type of focal therapy actually and he put a list there was a slide that\n showed all the different types of focal therapy that are available and the advantages are real if you can find a skilled focal therapist and if if your Anatomy sets up for focal therapy not everyone's going to be a candidate but if the anatomy is favorable then there's going to be a much lower risk of erectile dysfunction in this modern era with things like space ore and crackerjack radiation therapy the the bad things that we used to hear about happening frequently rectal Burns bladder burns are very rare but there's\n still a problem with erectile dysfunction and people that have focal therapy have a much lower risk of erectile dysfunction so people that see that as a priority that have favorable Anatomy shop around talk to different experts because it's a little bit like the Wild West it's still not a regulated area focal therapy I think is here to stay and I think it's going to become more popular um I have no comment on that so I uh think do you want to is there anything I just I was happy that Dr Rossi who\n always does a good job there's no question in the area protons I everyone would agree he's number one everybody around the world knows who he is I just I was glad we talked about side effects that that made me happy so that's my only comment on that um do you want to talk about Sheridan yes so psma pet scans are I think the biggest breakthrough since the discovery of PSA the industry hasn't really begun to digest the ramifications of this tremendous breakthrough but if you think about it it's fairly\n straightforward we've been using how high is the PSA what's the Gleason score how many core biopsies are positive to try and project whether or not the disease is spread outside the prostate is there anything else that matters besides whether or not the disease spread outside the prostate the answer is no there's really nothing else that matters did it spread or not is it a cancer or is it a pretend cancer is it a paper tiger well we know from our experience with Gleason three plus three there's a\n lot of prostate cancers that don't ever spread what many people don't know is there's a lot of Gleason sevens eights and nines that never spread that is shocking to people but of course they all get treated no one's waiting around to see if they spread because we know that there is a risk of spread and so everyone historically has been treated but now with psma pet scans when someone's diagnosed with a higher Gleason score we know that they've had that disease for a number of years and if the psma\n Pet Scan is not showing any metastatic disease we have a much more accurate indication of to as to whether that disease is likely to spread based on whether it has already spread so this information is not being factored into all the historical algorithms and how can this change the way we manage prostate cancer well one way it may change the way people think is how much hormone therapy is given to a high risk patient hormone treatment for 18 to 24 months has been the standard for a long time for gleasonate disease because\n there was maybe a 20-25 chance that the disease had already spread now we have scans that show a much lower likelihood of spread can we modify the duration of hormone therapy so these are some of the analyzes that are in process but we don't have studies yet but I think that that aspect of the psma pet scans is going to change the way we think about intermediate high-risk disease another thing that was mentioned briefly I think you brought the question up is can we do a psma pet scan instead of a biopsy in someone that has an abnormal\n MRI or a high PSA the use of focal or targeted biopsies I think have has made the the downside dangers of biopsy much less and I'm not as intimidated by thought of someone going through a couple of biopsies instead of a dozen biopsies which is the standard random approach that's still popular but people that have plenty of financial resources and say you mean I can just take a scan and not have any biopsy I think people should be aware of that possibility these psma pet scans are quite accurate for picking up prostate\n cancer inside the prostate as well as outside if a Psy pet scan isn't showing any disease inside the prostate why would we do a biopsy on that person we may continue to monitor them but it's kind of cool that maybe in certain cases we can avoid a biopsy altogether so those are just some of the things that came out in my thinking during the the psma I was happy he mentioned places that you could travel to if you're if there's that level of desperation pcri has built a very strong foundation on if you can't get it here but can get\n it somewhere else that's your prerogative and we can possibly tell you where to go get that so I think it's easy to talk about what might not have worked but I think people forget that for how many years five six seven years people were getting psma scans before they were FDA approved right down the street because people were coming this meeting and we were saying you can get them right down the street right now yeah you're in a so-called clinical trial but this is just an information gathering study so\n for years before approval second thing with the luticium before going to Germany we were going to Australia so what I what made me happy about his Talk is sometimes academically we get stuck in a box is that he did mention there were all these other places he tells patients that he that he could they could possibly go if there's a desperate situation that made me happy about his talk Freddie now here's the we only got about 700 questions and you can tell I have no life I've read every single one of them in my room\n so I tried to group them in a lot of them well before I go into where a lot of them went here was a couple on testosterone therapy if someone's had prostate cancer so if someone's been treated for prostate cancer and a couple of these questions it's a year or two later PSA is low or undetectable their testosterone's low but they heard testosterone can accelerate the growth of an existing tumor do people go on testosterone replacement therapy after they've been treated for prostate cancer\n or is that just too dangerous well that's an excellent question because there's experts will come down on all sides of that question the my my personal view is that because of the intermittent hormone therapy trials that were done 15 20 years ago where they allowed people to stop taking hormone therapy and their natural testosterone would return we have actually pretty good data showing that that's not dangerous as long as they're monitored so why would we be afraid of giving testosterone in someone who stops Lupron but their\n testosterone never returns spontaneously we're just replicating what happens when you stop Lupron in their and their testicles make the testosterone so the same testosterone so the giving testosterone is a we could probably do a whole talk a whole a whole conference on testosterone it's fascinating stuff Mark and I had dinner on Thursday night and we were both getting all excited about talking about muscle loss and aging and Mark's an expert on that and I think we need to hear from him a little bit about that\n before this today is out testosterone is probably one of the biggest things to help rebuild muscle which is a very important thing in the in aging gracefully so so the answer the simple answer is that we in our practice because we've given a lot of Lupron and we have a lot of Aging patients people with low testosterone levels we I'm sure between Dr lam my partner myself we've got over 100 patients that are taking testosterone in different forms we monitor them closely again we could talk about the the modus operandi\n for hours but yeah I think that the simple answer is that under supervision just giving testosterone to prostate cancer patients or people that have previously had prostate cancer is something on the table for consideration uh do you want to jump into the uh Sarco penis well I I wanted to do a Part B to that because if there were a couple questions there are people on hormone therapy Androgen deprivation therapy for one mentioned three years I mentioned five and now they're off and they're wondering when they're going to get\n their testosterone back right yeah so you just please explain the longer you're on hormone therapy what happens right so and this if there's a medicine called orgovix which is the pill that Dr Heath mentioned as a substitute for Lupron shots that has more predictable testosterone recovery when you stop Lupron shots elegant Trail star shots the galorex otherwise known as firmigon all these medicines tend to have lingering low testosterone levels even after you stop the treatment and that becomes a bigger and bigger problem as\n we get older so a 50 year old man may have robust recovery of testosterone after he stops Lupron 75 year old may never recover testosterone so so that's uh there's just a lack of awareness how much you can have lingering effects after these shots and I wanted to mention uh I know I'm getting off the topic a little bit but I wanted to mention that the orgavix pills are much less likely to do that and so that's one of the attractions of considering that therapy rather than Lupron if you're on a time a period of\n the hormone therapy for a period of time and you're going to get off and you're expecting to recover your normal testosterone you're much more likely to recover it on the Organics I mean it's surprised me how many people don't know that the pills came out I mean they quietly came out it seems I mean of course the advertisements are in the medical journals but it quietly came out and I can't say how many people I've talked on the phone they'll say wait what is that let's say it's a pill\n option for hormone therapy there's sort of an awareness problem I mean whether you get into the weeds of which one's better or not the bigger issue is there's just a lack of awareness that you can go home with these pills and you take a loading dose and then you take just a single dose every day and then it you can do that instead of coming in for a shot if that's what you prefer but the fact that it's added as another option that has to come up in a conversation because some people love that sense of\n self-control and some people love that they want to start and stop when they want to start and stop other people say no I'd rather go in to see Schultz and he sticks a needle in a certain place and gives me that shot and you know but the point is people just don't know about all the options the different months of options the pills and so more options better options the only thing I've heard is that the cost can you comment on that that some people have run into some cost issues on it that was something that Dr Heath brought\n up too is the medications that have come out are truly groundbreaking but they they're spectacularly expensive and so the the push-pull between insurance companies and uh and patients and doctors is all I think every all three of the doctors today talked about what a headache that is it's battling with insurance companies but we are asking these insurance companies to make gigantic Financial outlays so the Organics I think is something in the order of two or three thousand dollars a month the the second generation hormone medicines\n like extandi or Lida nubecca or somewhere in the range of 10 to 15 000 a month for the pills it's insanely expensive and surprisingly Insurance often will pay for these things it's really mind-boggling so in that context I think it's good to know that one of the four second generation hormone medicines aberratorone also known as zytiga has become generic and this is what I think our system does work all these medicines extending and Becca these 10 15 000 medicines or orgovix a three thousand dollar medicine will\n become generic at some point and become very accessible zytiga has become generic it's as efficacious as the other medications that I mentioned new Becca or Leta and extandy but you can pick it up at Costco for like eighty dollars a month and it used to be ten thousand dollars a month so so the we got to give credit to the fact that zytiga development was some something around a billion dollars worth of investment the pharmaceutical company that brought us cytiga which was one of the most groundbreaking breakthroughs it\n came out around I think 2010. and it emptied out my infusion area historically we had lots of people taking chemotherapy since zytiga has been out we've basically we're probably using five percent of the amount of chemotherapy that we used 10 years ago because this stuff is so efficacious people go under remissions they stay in remission a long time eighty dollars a month what a bargain so so yeah there's a lot of complexities here and what kind of insurance will cover it which won't orgavix's Lupron shots are almost\n universally covered by Medicare for example and private insurances orgovix maybe yes maybe no has some advantages perhaps are they three thousand dollars better than Lupron shots well if your insurance covers it perhaps so especially if you're hoping to get predictable testosterone recovery when you stop therapy yeah it's quick drop quick recovery some people say well you know you want that extra suppression time that's what the trial showed but to me again it's here are the options here are the pros and cons adults aren't\n children they're big boys and girls they should pick what suits their lifestyle and what they want after they've been given the information the problem is keeping up with all these hormone-changing drugs has been daunting and very few people get all the information so anyway I don't know I've even answered your question I got off on my soapbox there no I mean you answered the question I mean sometimes when you add when you answer a question it makes me think of the questions that I'm also\n getting here so you talked about zaitiga aberrator on being really expensive and then cheaper ever owners itiga comes with prednisone can you please because this comes up constantly can you please explain why it is absolutely necessary in general to take your Prednisone with that drug because otherwise you can run into problems and can you walk people through that sure I mean zytiga has occasional problems with increased blood pressure in fact all these second generation hormone therapies can increase your blood pressure fluid retention\n occasionally it'll irritate the liver this is detectable with a blood tests and it can also deplete you of the the normal cortisone that you get from your adrenal glands every day and so that's why they ask you to take a little bit of Prednisone which is a type of cortisone to compensate turns out that the the prednisone is usually not a big deal if someone is is absolutely horrified by the thought of taking cortisone there's some other potassium sparing diuretics that could be substituted I'm not blocking on the\n name of it right now we generally don't bother because people tolerate the prednisone very well one other little trick in cost savings is so 80 a month seems like a small figure to me for the type of results we get was itga but you can actually cut the costs even further because taking zytica with food doubles its potency so many of our patients instead of taking a thousand milligrams every morning on an empty stomach will take 500 milligrams in the morning with breakfast take their five milligram prednisone pill right along with it and\n and that works just as well yeah the company really liked that study a lot when it came out you would be taking less medication that's right and get the same you remember when that study came out so the good is with a high fat diet you get more bang for your buck on less pills the bad news is if you end up taking more than less and then also take the meal you can be exposed to a lot of drug right so you got to make sure you take less and that's right you don't want to take a thousand Millions right exactly\n so that the dark side of that is you can be Overexposed to the drugs so you want to make sure you cut down on drugs but yeah that was a that was a an amazing finding in terms of that um the one thing a bunch of biopsy questions I'm sorry look at what I'm laughing is anytime we talk biopsy it's just like here we go look out it's now shows is going to hold court so I don't mind so the questions were uh again the transperineal versus transactal biopsies and then the second one that we will get\n until the day we go into the dirt all of us is that do biopsies spread cancer I we got a bunch of those so it's a two-part question tell us yeah I think that's an easy one okay we'll take that first the answer is no okay a million men are getting biopsied every year if we were spreading cancer around we'd have known that a long time ago but yes it is true a million men go through random biopsy every year in the United States it's a billion dollar business and you're giving me an opportunity to\n talk about it and I'll get on my soapbox that's really sad there was a nice um a definitive article in the New England Journal of Medicine in December of 2022 that done in Scandinavian something like 12 or 14 000 people where they looked at how much uh random biopsy in addition to targeted biopsy improves your your chances for finding bad cancers the you know the thinking with random biopsies is well let's just be careful we'll stick needles everywhere in the prostate so that if if something isn't showing up on the MRI at\n least we'll find it and the beauty of that study because validated what I've been saying now for about eight years is that they didn't find any any disease that needed treatment with the random biopsy as long as it was a good quality MRI and the targeted biopsy was done properly and so that was a New England Journal of Medicine the most prestigious Journal large study something like 12 000 patients and no Advantage for random biopsy anymore so the the trick of course is finding competence centers that do good MRIs\n since we're banking on the quality of the MRI and not all MRI centers are created equal and then the doctor that does the targeted biopsy has to be experienced because the needle has to go into the target for you to really sample what's going on but I think that that again I think I got off topic a little bit there mark my apologies but I you you covered it but it's the trans you know transparent yeah the transparent I'm sorry so where do where are we with trans perennials so the biggest side effect of biopsies is\n not spreading the disease the biggest side effect is infection when typically we're poking the needle through the rectum that's a dirty spot of the body so infections in otherwise healthy people we're talking about serious infections where people go to the hospital and get intravenous antibiotics and with random biopsies they're reporting about a two percent incidence of of a serious septic complications after these biopsies so if we got a million people every year that are having these random\n biopsies and what one percent of a million is ten thousand what are we looking 20 000 people a year that get serious septic complications if I'm doing my math right so the transperrineal concept is that instead of sticking the needle through the through the rectal wall you stick it through the perineum which is the skin between your rectum and your and your scrotum and you're not going through the rectum and you're going to have a lower risk of infections that's definitely true interestingly the infection risk\n isn't quite zero it's still somewhat less than one percent but it's better the problem with trans perennial biopsies you're going through more tissue it's more uncomfortable some doctors are even put putting people to sleep to do this general anesthesia which is not good in our age group doesn't help memory other doctors are skillful using local anesthesia which would be reasonable but it is more difficult and takes more skill to hit spots on a transparently biops because the prostate is this far away from the\n skin rather than this far away through the rectum so so it so that's one way to cut down on the risk of infectious another nice study came out showing that if you're doing a targeted biopsy without a random biopsy in other words instead of jabbing the needle a dozen times through the rectal wall no surprise we're getting infections but if you just do two to four biopsies targeted through the rectum your risk of infection drops down to less than one percent so so I I haven't been pushing for transparental biopsies a little more\n cumbersome a little more uncomfortable a little bit more more a little bit further away a little more difficult to Target there are good doctors that are doing them I'm advocating continue with the Trans rectal biopsies but only targeted not random we had a number of questions but the number of people have called in through the years and talked about someone's been biopsying something that there's must be a cancer there they can't find it and then you've sent people for what's called imbore\n can you can you explain to people that they have that option and I became a Believer after seeing a couple of these after a couple of these cases where they couldn't find anything and the person that is so frustrated which I understand and then they were sent locally for what's called an in-bore biopsy and they hit it they got they found it so can you so that was I sort of alluded to that that there's a skill doing targeted biopsies and the there's different ways to do them outpatient targeted biopsies are usually\n done with Fusion technology where they take the MRI images and stick it into an ultrasound and then use the ultrasound overlay to find this this purported spot but it seems like it should be more accurate I think it is more accurate for them to actually have the biopsy done in an MRI where they're looking at the spot and they can see the needle go into the spot so in bore the bore is the hole in the MRI so you're going into the to inside the MRI that's what an inborn biopsy means and I think that that is\n likely to be the most accurate way it's cumbersome because it's kind of slow but if you're having difficulty getting a clear answer or if especially with that what we call anterior lesions where the spots toward the front of the gland further away from the rectum an inborn biopsy while you're in the MRI is going to be the most accurate targeted biopsy playing that covers the biopsy area I think I don't want to needle you anymore with that subject sorry it's late in the day I appreciate\n that one fan of that pun but you didn't use the word Harpoon thank you this guy always likes to use the word Harpoon it comes to biopsy you know interestingly enough and this makes me happy the most questions we received we should deal with they all fell into one pool and that is the side effects of hormone therapy and that makes me very happy because I love hormone therapy and I don't mind the side effects our words never spoken by a single individual in their lives and so we have to keep we have to quit\n pretending like this is some walk in the park you are throwing someone into male menopause within weeks there's no Perry menopause there's no then menopause five years later it's not like menopause is fun on any side but whammo you're going right into menopause and like he said from A to Z there's all these potential issues that can come up acutely right up in the first few months or chronically over the next few years so why don't we talk about a couple of those all right the first one I want to talk about and\n I'll even think about this well I don't have to do it alphabetically but the one that we received a lot on are hot flashes and so I don't know you know why don't we comment on hot flashes a little bit in terms of because what you do is actually a little different I don't know if you've accepted that because I think I think a lot of people were stuck in a box with the manual wouldn't necessarily treat them that way they would want to treat with the very other traditional type of medicine but why don't you talk\n about hot flashes and besides keeping the room cool besides wearing loose fitting clothing uh what else can I do about these things because just so you know in my world hot flashes make up what's called vasomotor symptoms it's not just the hot flashes it's the idea that when you flash in the middle of the night it wakes you up it disturbs your sleep and then so it adds even a other component the the interruption of sleep into the game of hormone therapy side effects so what do you do about hot flashes\n first I asked people how much they're bothered by them and some people say yeah I notice them but they don't trouble me that much and we just live with them under those circumstances but they can they can disturb sleep and that's a very significant thing in terms of things that really produce results the top two things that really produce results are estrogen patches and progesterone and that probably dramatically reduces hot flashes in about 80 percent of men now estrogen orally is very dangerous for men it can\n cause blood clots but transdermal patches are are safe and effective so the main concern is you have to watch for breast enlargement and if that starts to happen either stop it or visit your friendly radiation therapist for a couple zaps to the breast area so estrogen patches progesterone I've gotten away from because it's a precursor to testosterone and usually that's an anathema when you're on hormone therapy so we haven't been using progesterone very much anymore and then less effective but occasionally\n effective medicines like Gabapentin or Effexor can be quite useful in certain individuals what I'm seeing in a lot of literature too is that once you ask someone on hormone therapy or your hot flashes bother you a lot of people say they don't bother me that much and then you with more investigation they bother you a lot but you just don't want to admit that they bother you that much so you have your you have your hormonal and non-hormonals so you offer all those options I think what's going to happen is and I've always told people\n I've learned more from breast cancer than about just side effects of hormone therapy than any cancer because they've dealt with them for so long and some of the most promising things that end up working for menopause will work its way into prostate cancer so right now there's several drugs in phase three trial that are showing significant non-hormonal drugs for women really significant drops in hot flashes and other types of vasal motor symptoms and they've got nice long names one just got one just finished a trial is going\n for FDA approval I think they're going to work its way over and change the game here in the next few years or the next year or two in prostate cancer so it's always nice to watch what's happening in breast cancer with hot flashes because it's not like we see a ton of breakthroughs in this area right yeah veru is coming up with a product too it's a small startup company but I don't remember the name of their product the the estellas one is uh pheasolinotent or something like that and it's um it's\n already passed through phase three and I bumped into someone at a meeting who I knew and they said that they were going to move into prostate and they don't see any reason why again it's a non-hormonal thing it actually affects there's a part of the brain that it's a temperature sensor the hypothalamus and it affects it there and so I I have great hope for it I on the lighter side of things interestingly enough because I had to write some papers on how to handle certain things in urology and and sort\n of clinical papers and I keep reminding people the data there is an acupuncture acupuncture if you can find someone that's competent there and it doesn't charge you too much acupuncture for hot flashes even once a week or once every two weeks has picked up enough Steam and so some people will say it doesn't have enough data but the truth is in in men in prostate cancer there's been enough small pilot trials now that you start to see it getting recommended at least we know it doesn't make the situation worse\n but can improve the situation and you don't need to get the treatment that often anymore for maintenance and maybe it's also a good barometer because if that's not helping after several treatments then maybe you can go for more more of the hard stuff if you want it so I like how acupuncture is found a little home there in terms of hormone therapy and people like to talk about Placebo and this and that but you know there's been enough there to to consider it a potential option so that covers that unless there's anything else\n you want no I'm glad you mentioned acupuncture I think that's real the studies are are pretty convincing the problem with some of the over-the-counters on hot flashes everyone who knows me I think I think supplements are an incredible field I don't think they get good objectivity and the problem is I live in a world where almost everyone I started with 35 years ago has either moved to some industry they sell their own product line so there's very few people that don't have involvement with companies so\n I I like to say that I don't and I'm free of that but at the same time I believe supplements need to get more respect but they also need more objectivity there's a lot of hot flash remedies over the counter on the female side black cohosh red clover all these all these different things the problem is they really haven't been tested on the prostate side so it's more of a wild west on the prostate side that's why I get more excited about acupuncture we just don't we just don't have those you know does\n it cause liver toxicity does it interact with your medication you know God forbid so I just never I've never jumped on that bandwagon on the over-the-counters on the men's side all right let's talk about bone loss because this this makes me really I again people want me to talk about vitamin D but I think the deficiency is indexa can we please talk about osteoporosis screening and why I personally believe even if you have to pay cash that anybody on hormone therapy should get one potentially who's about to start\n hormone therapy get a Baseline and then if they're going long term to get another one maybe a year later or if they're even going to come off after six nine months get another one a year later it is one of the most underutilized tools that I think is used in prostate that is not used in prostate cancer what say you I agree I I we tend to treat people empirically with anti-bone loss medications we published a small pilot trial at least an abstract form using medicines like Boniva actinel Prolia Fosamax showing that people who\n went on antiosteoporosis medicine at the same time they started Lupron didn't lose bone and it seems kind of funny that the industry wants you to lose a certain amount of bone in other words become osteoporotic and then start a medicine to try and fix it where I would think we want to prevent it from happening in the first place so I um certainly am happy with getting bone densities scanned but our usual policy if someone's going to be on hormone therapy for a year or more is to start some sort of treatment certainly make\n sure they take a little calcium at bedtime make sure their vitamin D levels are normal and supplement them if they're low and we haven't gotten around to the sarcopenia thing but the the weight training protocols that help you keep your muscles also help build bone as well perhaps better than almost anything else so the the typical preventative policy that should be implemented in every man with low testosterone is a combination of these things and the yes we do check bone density tests but we don't wait\n around for problems to start treatment vitamin D and calcium very important to get I think you know there's no there's no group that has come out and said we all should be generally screened for vitamin D deficiency I I agree with that vitamin D test is a good test it's not a great test but where it's a really good task for people who's starting hormone therapy because if someone's coming in super low there's a problem there's a real problem there's also something else because I had to do this\n vitamin D podcast recently this this guest thing and I was telling people that one a lot of Physicians don't realize I don't think because it's not advertised and you can go look at this next time you see your prescription for any bone drugs a lot of people equate vitamin D with bone health and that's fine but a lot of people are walking around today doing just fine with vitamin D because it's now found in in everything you know they've doubled it up in multivitamins people are supplementing more and more they're\n putting in plant-based milks but what one thing that gets missed all the time in the prescribing information for all the bone drugs is that when you go on a bone drug there's a higher risk of it dropping your calcium precipitously and causing a problem it's it's it doesn't happen to a lot of people it's called hypocalcemia and one of the ways you combat hypocalcemia is carrying a decent amount of vitamin D and taking calcium so another reason you have to consider calcium and vitamin D when you're on\n hormone therapy is yeah the bone part is important but it also prevents a potential side effect from one of the most commonly prescribed drugs for bone health in men and women and that's another reason to be excited about vitamin D and calcium not just the fact that you should just normalize intake now people say well what's a normal intake you can always do well there's a lot of different societies with opinions but almost all of them will be of the opinion that men and women have to get between a thousand and 1200 milligrams a\n day and if you get it from diet that much better because the truth of the matter is is that there's so much calcium around today that if you start adding pills to that and you get too much calcium you can say hello to two things that are not so nice one's called constipation and the other thing is called kidney stones so I was drinking my plant-based milk before I came to California and I was looking at it and one of them was a macadamia nut milk that had 300 milligrams per eight ounces another one had an almond milk had 400\n to 450 milligrams of calcium for one cup wow so we are being inundated by calcium I think a lot of people are surprised that they don't need some supplements if they just do a quick diary and see how much they're getting day in and day out and then there's also the side effect option that can occur in that case but there like I said vitamin D and calcium have a necessary place that doesn't get recognized and that's to reduce the toxicity or side effect of the bone health drugs and I wish that would get\n more play so there's that the other thing I can want to say about bone health is that in my world when when when you be whenever you hear the words that this is the key like the word superfood that's that's a word that makes me nuts right because to me I had three cucumbers at the at the meeting it's the most boring food in the world and I love it to me that's a superfood you know it's very low calorie I get a little bit of fiber a decent amount of potassium virtually no sodium that to me\n that's a superfood but it costs very little to buy a cucumber it's kind of dull to look at to me that's my superfood so people are always looking for the cat's meow like what's the one thing that can drive this here so what's the problem with calcium and vitamin D is it's become so equated with bone health you makes you think like what else what else can I do for my bone health there's no question that through the years of looking at research of people that take care of themselves that\n they eat healthier they have a higher quality diet they have a higher chance of improved bone health even though they're not necessarily getting more calcium and vitamin D so what's going on here we're learning that other compounds found in healthy foods probably offset bone loss another one of those is potassium so in urology for example there's a drug used in a supplement called potassium citrate for people who have high risk for kidney stones in Cleveland Clinic and other people have gone back and looked at people that take\n this medicine or they get a lot of it for example from food and they're seeing a lower rate of bone loss suggesting that potassium that's found in so many healthy foods we're not saying take the pill may have an impact on bone health but the point of this message is whenever you hear that this is the key this is the one or two items from from food that can make or break your health It generally means there's a lot of other players that aren't getting attention that we haven't learned about\n and there's a saying I've said for corporate gigs and other gigs I've done in the past that if you can remember anything else in diet just remember that the healthiest foods first of all in the grocery store get no Health advertisements so you need to First seek out foods that have no Health ads those are the healthiest foods like whole unprocessed food right so you have to go to that area and look for it because it's not going to say makes you heart healthy improves your bone health those are the more in\n my opinion desperate companies that are looking to get that added Edge but what I always tell people is you know you're eating healthy food when you remember the saying that healthy nutrients love to travel in herds together without ads healthy nutrients love to travel together in herds without ads what's that mean that means when someone for example picks up something like an avocado or an artichoke because I'm a huge fan it says in my bio I love artichokes which is true at Michigan I love artichokes I'm just fascinated by\n them I find it interesting that they are extremely low calorie they're one of the highest sources of fiber they have virtually no sodium they're loaded with potassium you're not seeing added excess sugar in there you're just seeing magnesium you're seeing all the healthy nutrients you can imagine found in that one low calorie place don't you find it interesting how they're all hanging out together you know whether you look at an avocado that's high in a monounsaturated fat called oleic acid which is similar\n to what you see in in olive oil and you get a large amount of fiber you get a large amount of potassium you get a large amount of magnesium but you're not seeing excess sugar you're not seeing excess sodium you know you're not seeing are these artificial ingredients so all these healthy things are hanging out together it's not just that the avocado is a great source of healthy fat it's a great source of a lot of healthy nutrients and now we're starting to discover other things so we're doing a\n series for pcri they came out and flew to our kitchen and we're doing a series starting in two weeks where we probably do six to ten modules on eating better and how to look at things differently to get excited about them and our first module if you don't mind me telling you that's going to be released and the first one that I wanted to do is for most of my career people were walking around and you may have heard of this that Tomatoes might fight prostate cancer because of lycopene so people lost their freaking Minds after that\n study came out you go to your local grocery store you couldn't even buy a tomato that must have been the secret if you just go buy a tomato it kills prostate cancer and that's it it's the lycopene but the original studies from Harvard and other places that showed that lycopene can help was actually a study of diverse fruits and vegetables whole fruits and vegetables it wasn't necessarily all about the Tomato so people get excited about the Tomato so if I finally I decided this is silly I want people to get excited about\n something like asparagus asparagus is low calorie how many people know that the USDA studied asparagus recently and found lycopene and asparagus what the lycopene is I thought the red pigment that makes the tomato red for example you find it in guava yes that's true but this nutrient can also be found in a variety of other healthy foods and just because they're not red doesn't mean they don't have them and yes it might be a small amount but again it's the diversity of healthy food you're being\n exposed to this but this idea that one type of food is going to solve it is where people get themselves in trouble so our first series is on where to find lycopene in the simplest places and without having to take a ton of pills to go find it but really when you're saying you're seeking out lycopene you're just saying you're seeking out healthy whole unprocessed Foods that's all you're saying there's a bigger picture there so that's my soapbox for the day no no I got another one for you okay the um so\n so this whole vitamin D thing you can see that you know that our guys that are without testosterone and losing calcium rapidly uh probably should be on some vitamin D but I have a lot there's two fetishes that I want to address publicly here one is uh that if a little bit of vitamin D is good more is better and the other one I want to take up after that is uh eight glasses of water a day all right yeah let's go to the vitamin D one first uh yeah I know you've studied this a lot and looked into it a great depth\n you know I have patients that are you know shooting to get there the normal range of vitamin D is like 30 to 100 and I have patients taking five ten thousand units a day and they're trying to get their vitamin D up to 80 to 90. as if it has some magical benefit and I'm not sure what that benefit would be and I know you've the benefit has been sold and you know I'm 30 almost 40 years into my first paper and one thing I've learned a lot of things like you have in a long career is it's like people say well why\n don't you do Consulting anymore why don't you have a clinic and do this it's because now it's a time for public health I traveled four million miles teaching it's time to you know really get education there out on a fairly large level as opposed to just always hitting doctor groups or patient groups or all that stuff but what I've learned over many many decades it generally is very true that there's there's sort of a fine line there's a moderate amount of exposure that's healthy where too little\n is not good and clearly too much is not better and we just have countless examples of that where you think more is better you will wake up and realize it's the opposite and A good rule of thumb is finding where that moderate line is and if someone's saying there's no moderate line there that you can just keep going with it that means there's there's a concern that we either don't know the answer or you're betting on a horse that has no chance of winning so in the old days which was a few years\n ago if you and I bet you I'll challenge you to go look at any of your your Labs you'll look at Vitamin D blood tests a lot of the labs will used to say for example 20 or 30 to 100 is a normal level and the labs would put 30 to 100 it wasn't necessarily based on any research the idea that that gigantic of a range is normal I'm just trying to equate it with you it's like saying well well a normal total cholesterol is between 100 and 700.\n you would go what is this nonsense that's not true so what we've learned now is vitamin D is being tested over and over again is that too little runs you into problems and too much is clearly running you into problems and what it's doing is it's increasing the risk of what's called hypercalcemia where your calcium level goes too high in the blood and wreaks absolute Havoc as you know the oncologists know and then that calcium spills over into the urine it's called hypercalcyuria and then say hello to kidney stones in a\n variety of other plus it's just bad for the kidney and so now if you look at if you go home tonight or the next few days just go to Mayo Clinic labs for example you know go to a reasonable lab reference and you look at Vitamin D tests and it will say something now that okay we don't mind the 20 30 40 but when you start going to 50 and above hypercalcemia hypercalciuria may increase the risk of Falls may increase the risk of other things I don't want to tell you about that could scare you because we're\n learning now finally with trials that what happens when you get too much and then if you get too little we've always known but I always get nervous when people sell that more is better I just feel like they're selling something they're selling a gimmick and it's so easy too the other great story about vitamin D is vitamin D was tested by itself I am perfectly fine with going to CVS or Walgreen and buying one of the cheapest vitamin D's like CVS has a program called tested to be trusted they test\n all their products why they don't advertise this more is beyond me if I was working for CVS I would go listen people you need to advertise your quality control I have not personally found a relationship between paying more for vitamin D and necessarily getting more in fact people have to understand in the over-the-counter world you're allowed to be generic immediately that's why you'll find a brand name at one of the pharmacies and you'll find a generic right next to it when it comes out and\n it's the same way in a lot of supplements and I know this won't make me a fortune in the future but some of the cheapest supplement products actually have the most research and they have the most quality control so I can buy a bottle of vitamin D for 600 IU or 800 IU units I can pay five ten dollars and have enough for six to 12 months this idea that people are paying a fortune for it is mind-boggling they're being sold on something so let me go further so they finally decided to test really high dosages and generally\n healthy people that were getting older the study was published in Jama General American Medical Association it was by Bert L at all and they went to really high levels like ten thousand they looked at bone health they were just giving them more and lo and behold they found as they gave more over this two-year trial they found there was a higher risk of this increase of calcium and increase of calcium in the urine that was you know concerning and they only expected we know unexpected yeah but it was the effects\n calcium yeah it was happening and then they found more bone loss at the higher dosages wow so these are people that are doing these studies because they think they're going to find more bone not more bone loss right so there's some there's a point where the body goes I'm getting too much here let's shut this down and I give the example of testosterone replacement therapy when you give the body a ton of product that it normally can make on its own sometimes the response is hey you obviously don't need us anymore\n let's shut this Factory down and let's shut it down permanently in some cases so there are some people that take too much testosterone they've been on it too long and when they come off of it the testicles aren't making it anymore it's the same thing with someone taking too much thyroid medication they over they overtake too many hormones so you also have to be careful about taking too many pills on something that the human body makes when there's so many wonderful sources we did a course with the\n students at Michigan the only plug I'm going to make today is the last podcast I did was I don't do many for Michigan medicine they asked me it was called is vitamin D important and I review all the data it's free just go type in Michigan medicine Mark Moyet is vitamin D important it's 20 minutes of where vitamin D looks promising and where it doesn't look promising as of a couple weeks ago but what we did with the students and the the residence last year they came to my house and we cook salmon\n and we went through a quiz and and it's really interesting so the quiz was for example if you like wild Alaskan salmon is a wild Alaskan salmon high in vitamin D is it B high in protein is it C high in potassium is it d uh high in selenium or is it e high in B12 and you know me I like to joke around everyone's going circling this I'm going it's all wrong it's all the above and that that goes back to my point of healthy products like to travel in herds together you know these nutrients love\n to travel people don't realize that salmon is a great source of B12 um so the and it's a huge source of vitamin D and if I was in the wild salmon Market I would be advertising the vitamin D levels being found in some of the wild salmon can be three four times higher than in other types and that was studied by Boston University so there's great sources of vitamin D I think it's okay to get it checked but it's especially important for those on hormone therapy for so many reasons and please do not let someone sell you on\n the concept that more is better thank you and the eight glasses of water a day the reason this is being in my existence is the your body doesn't digest water and unless you live in Alabama and perspire all day long your everything that you imbibe is going to be urinary doubt and oftentimes in the middle of the night I have a lot of people coming to me on a daily basis complaining about urinary urgency frequency getting up at night frequently and and I asked them how much water they drink and they're really\n proud of themselves you know I'm doing my eight glasses a day like somehow that validates them as a good human and this the roots of a lot of HTO intake come go all the way back to the Inception of the macrobiotic diet in 1920. which strongly uh encouraged a vegetarian type diet which actually was way ahead of its time and quite brilliant but they piggybacked this eight glasses of water a day along with it which if you ask the experts that I've talked to the nephrologists the kidney experts the only people that will\n benefit from large amounts of water intake are people that have a history of kidney stones that will help reduce that risk but for the rest of us I think we're mostly making ourselves miserable and if you limit your water intake tubes just when you're thirsty remember food has water in it food has a lot of water in it so if you're drinking a lot of water before you go to bed you're going to be waking up at night but am I wrong in any way have you found anything that would contradict that I know this is\n your Dr Moyet the reason I put that to him Dr Moyet has written books about alternative medicines vitamins supplements herbal he's he's this is really his expertise so you know it's just that it goes back to just these principles that will guide you very well we'll talk about a few more before we finish today the healthy nutrients love to travel in herds together without ads part of the way you know you're eating a healthy product is it's water content in general is very high um so 20 to 25 of your daily water\n intake comes from food and so the people who eat very healthy foods fruits veggies and they get a lot of healthy food tend to get a lot of water and so a lot of people again will say it's this that Roots reduces the risk of the kidney stone well it could be also the foods they're eating because they're very high in anti-stone ingredients right so it's a wonderful thing to eat healthy food and get water from there the second thing I've always told audiences and people my entire life is that there's a\n really good rule of thumb when it comes to water and it comes to dehydration because it is true as we get older we lose the ability to do a lot of things that we we took for granted when we were in our 20s or 30s like when I go to Michigan football game and if I have a soda or something I can't hold it I gotta run to the bathroom shoot you take me 20 30 years earlier I can hold it for four quarters until we win the game right so things change and one of the things has changed is the sensors that tell us we're thirsty or not or we're\n actually dehydrated so if we can get into trouble as we get older we don't know we're hydrated or dehydrated A good rule of thumb that is a general rule of thumb is I used to tell audiences all the time just remember that after a workout especially because like this morning when I went running I looked for this or after lifting weights remember the concept of clear is cool clear is where you want to be so you don't want dark urine you don't want urine that's semi-ellow ultimately after a workout or\n you put in physical activity you want to drink enough water where you see clear urine it's colorless you're filtering now you've done very well you've hydrated enough that the urine is free of being concentrated and you're seeing nothing but clear come out the reason why when you wake up in the morning and you haven't had much to drink the night before or you've had too much alcohol the urine is completely yellow it's fully concentrated you're dehydrated so clear is cool is a good concept the idea\n that you got to pick a number and when you achieve that number you'll achieve Nirvana and go to heaven is crazy it's just it just sounds good it's just trying to make things simple but in the area of kidney stones higher water consumption is good but you can get again that consumption from a lot of food products it doesn't have to come from water the area where people run into trouble as they get older is they get urgency and the people who have suffered from overactive bladder and know that they're urologist or their\n team will tell them that be careful not to consume too many food fluids because that's going to make your urgency that much worse it's going to make the bladder spasm it's going to get you up in the middle of the night there's clearly situations where more is not better when it comes to water so I wouldn't use the eight glasses I never have I use the clear as cool phenomenon and it's it helps me make decisions in my own personal life after I do a workout for example so yeah I agree with you it was it was a\n wonderful thing to say but it's gotten a lot of people in trouble in fact if you really want to know the history of how it got people into trouble is that the Boston Marathon uh used to just in most marathons when you run them just used to give water you go by and you go after a mile they give you water and then people would drink so much water they developed a condition called hyponatremia they diluted their blood to the point where they had seizures so um a young woman died at the Boston Marathon long ago it was a case written\n up in the New England Journal of Medicine they realized she was exposed to too much water during the race and that led that study from Harvard of this young woman that died during the race led to in many other cases led to why when you do athletic events you also get Gatorade or you get electrolyte drinks it's not just straight water because the body needs electrolytes too as you begin to deplete sweat as you put in more physical activity so it's part of the whole teaching tool yeah and and the hyponatremia problem of too much water\n intake is is a bigger problem as we get older because our kidneys don't concentrate urine as well when we get in our 70s and 80s so occasionally I'll we routinely check sodium levels in the blood whenever we get someone's PSA we get a basic metabolic panel that checks your kidney function your potassium levels your sodium levels and if I have patients who they otherwise feel fine but you look at their blood test results and it shows that their sodium levels are low I know that there they've got a water\n fetish they that's they are drinking so much water they are depleting their body of salt and it can get very dangerous if it goes to an extreme and literally cause a seizure so if you're tracking your sodium levels you're protected but not everybody is if you have a desire to drink a lot of water and if you're getting up into your 70s and 80s make sure that you do check your sodium levels because you can wash so much salt out of your system it can become dangerous yeah and a lot and some of the\n antihypertensive drugs some people take certain medications diuretics they can lose electrolytes so these are good things to look at in the labs which I know you and I have talked about but there's a lot to this water game and of course the truth lies somewhere in the middle it's not such an extreme situation so hopefully that helps you a little bit what was the other topic we were going to talk about I thought we wanted to cover more hormone blockade side effects oh yeah we wanted to cover more side effects we're going to cover\n muscle loss so we talked about we talked about this condition and it is a it is an epidemic condition not just on hormone therapy just in at any age group today and it's called sarcopenia encircopenia sarcosis from the Greek word uh meaning flesh penia means a lack of our deficiency of there is no question that as you age the body likes to lose muscle mass and it starts at the age of 35 40 and then it's a percent or two every year or two you're literally fighting and it's interesting that most\n of this research came from prostate cancer patients who not were not necessarily on hormone therapy we just realized that when you were younger and you worked out with weights that you could take a few weeks off and your muscles would be just fine when you're 40 50 and 60 and you take a week or two off you go so quickly down the slope that you are backed up for several months to get back where you were so as you get older the body it takes a lot more effort to normalize where you were if you take a break of many many\n weeks so now you've got a drug that accelerates muscle loss on top of the muscle loss that you're already experiencing hormone therapy hormone therapy and it is why we have become just religious about the idea that in all these amazing mechanisms that we've discovered in drugs and these wonderful things that we talk about the meeting we still haven't found a single drug that does better than resistance exercise at stimulating muscle tissue and not only making the muscle tissue larger but making you\n stronger so think about it because that's so important believe me well why it's so important is not just for overall strength we know it reduces fatigue so one of the things that you hear about a lot with these drugs is I'm tired all the time well what happens is when you put on more muscle mass you increase metabolic rate so you become more of sort of an energy Powerhouse so you're able to get more energy during the day and so it's not just the skeleton it's not just the muscles overall it's the balance so when people\n get in trouble too as they get older as they lose balance and they fall so what they have found with lifting is it's not only heart healthy it's not only muscle healthy it's not only bone healthy it's not only nerve healthy it also reduces the risk of all these metabolic issues increases your energy level overall right memory healthy and memory healthy too anything I always say that's heart healthy is healthy from head all the way to the toes but we've also learned that you don't need to lift more weights to\n become stronger and healthier that was something we were taught that turned out not to be true as it got studied and what I mean by that is one of the biggest problems with lifting weights is that people think as they get stronger they have to go to a heavier weight and the problem is as you get older it just takes a moment to go to a heavier weight and suddenly you pull your back out or suddenly you're sidelined so what they decided to do in Canada another place and they decided to test the concept of you don't go to heavier weights you just\n lift less heavier weights or lower weights at more reps so instead of trying to go ah for six seven eight times like with a barbell or with an arm weight you'll go 12 15 20 until you're experiencing fatigue so you don't need to go up in weight you just need to go up in more reps so I still lift like a 25 pound um little a little hand weight and instead of doing 15 reps I'll do 20 to 25 and I'm completely exhausted what they ultimately found from these studies is that your strength and your muscle\n size was as good doing that is simply going up to Higher and Higher and Higher weights and that's personally what I've experienced too in my situation and and my personal self as I've gone to less and less weight and I have less and less injury overall so that's one thing you should take away from the lifting standpoint nobody is ever going to tell you and I've seen this comment in a pcri where you're on hormone therapy that you're really excited to exercise and lift weights it is a pain in the gluteus\n maximus it is a pain pain in the gluteus maximus but the beauty of it and where I want you to find beauty is that we have found this secret to maintaining all these benefits and you don't need a prescription and you don't got to pay this High copay it's there at your fingertips and when we generally see is that as I tell my kids and myself is your only one workout away from being in a good mood if someone's crabby and in my world all world leaders can only meet after they work out right families can only get\n together after they work out husbands Partners they can only have heated discussions after they work out this world would be a much better place amen so I'm on the treadmill this morning and today I decided to do high intensity interval training I'm just going to go three miles I'm going to go one really hard one really soft one really hard by the first I'm like I'm so tired man I've been doing this meeting 15 years how's it going to go I hit mile one I'm feeling pretty good I hit mile\n two I'm going yeah I know I'm feeling really great this is going to be a great day by mile 3 I'm going oh this is gonna be the best meeting ever there's no question in my mind and then really that's how it works that's how the brain works and it releases these neurotransmitters when you work out so the second the other point I want to make about weightlifting which doesn't get enough attention does anyone know who Tenzing Norgay is Tenzing Norgay is it was a sherpa that took Sir Edmund Hillary up to Everest\n the first time what I find so funny is this guy goes up to Everest with the sherpa the sherpa's like yeah come on we'll go to the top and you know he gets credit for being at the top of Everest but meanwhile this trip is just going up all the time right so he's kind of not getting the credit but he ended up getting credit so he's kind of behind the scenes not getting the love so this is how I want you to think about lifting and muscle the muscles there are certain muscles that just get all the love in\n the world and then the rest of them don't get any attention but they are critical to the balance to the strength to increasing energy and I wish we would push that more so I'll just give you two quick examples everyone wants to see the bicep oh if you're on the beach check out my bicep nobody really wants to see the tricep the poor old tricep is the tensing Norgay it sits out here but it makes up just as much volume as the bicep so it is just as important to do weightlifting that helps stimulate the\n tricep muscle as it is the bicep because of the shear volume that the tricep takes up and in terms of keeping your strength the second one is the quads so the front muscle mass boy yeah everyone wants to show you these the hamstrings no one gives a damn about they just sit back here they get absolutely no love right so when you're doing these leg extensions when I'm doing at the hotel I'm checking out my quadricep I'm feeling pretty good I think my wife's gonna think I'm sexy when I come home\n but then I realize there's these leg curls right and that works the hamstrings and it's a pain in the ass if you've ever tried these you can do a ton of weight this way by using this massive muscle but the hamstrings here you can put on 10-15 pounds and go oh my God I can barely lift this because it gets no attention it's really hard to exercise it so but what you're doing here is you're not only balancing this huge muscle with this huge muscle that increases your balance that increases\n the nerves that increases nerve function that increases skeletal function and it also allows you to get symmetrical volume and benefit so just remember about the Tenzing norgea muscles everyone wants to talk about this but no one to work on this everyone wants to work on the bicep but no one wants to work on the tricep and that's the other concept that I wish would get attention and it's not easy this morning when I was trying to work my tricep and then my other tensing Norgay muscles it was terrible I'm lifting about a third or\n half of what I'm lifting the other direction that's helping my quads so it's something else that that needs to be worked on when you're on hormone therapy because all of it starts to go fast it all starts to go fast in fact the Australians did a study that if you waited six months in the hormone therapy the chances that you would get back what you lost were minimal to nothing if you started the day you got the injection or took the pill you were able to maintain that amount of muscle mass you had a shot at it\n but if you wait a few months you're already so far behind the eight ball that you're struggling to get to where you need to go and so I just find it interesting that for almost every side effect so we call it cancer related fatigue CRF we call a muscle loss or for example your blood cholesterol goes up or you experience bone loss almost every side effect of hormone therapy has resistance exercise or aerobic exercise as an option to combat it and I find that to be beautiful doesn't mean that I think it's\n so easy to go out there and do it I just love that we have an option that doesn't cost a lot of money doesn't make me go into the doctor's office every two minutes to get it and this is something that if I do on my own it's going to help me from head to toe and that's why we talk about it and that's my speech on on Resistance exercise if you like Nautilus great if you like free weights great people get way too caught up in what's the best the one that you can stick to is the best\n because it's so hard to do that two or three times a week some people told me as we were talking on the side room we were also taught that you had to take a day like on a Tuesday let your muscles relax and then maybe let them relax and reorganize you know two to three days later and I'm going well where does that research come from so they looked at consecutive versus non-consecutive weightlifting because my problem is I'm really good for weightlifting Saturday and Sunday Monday through Friday I'm not\n very good but I was taught I had to take a few days off so they tested that that during the week even if you did two days in a row or and then you didn't do it for a couple days or let's say you did it on a Tuesday and a Thursday as long as you got those two or three days in you've got the same result you didn't have to take five days off in between so anyway that's that's the speech that's taking me way over and what's the next question on uh any other side effects we didn't talk about why don't\n we run through a couple other quick things and we'll call it a day yeah I mean that's in real estate it's location location and hormone therapy it's exercise exercise and then I think it was totally appropriate to really dig into that the only thing I would add is if you have Financial Resources hire professional supervision not so much because you need it you can probably do it on your own but the but the accountability or join it or join a club or join a a a group of people so you have have some energy to keep doing it\n on those days when you just don't want to do it that's it the motivational side of it is very challenging and whatever is necessary do it I review for a lot of medical journals like the Journal of Urology I review I get to decide whose paper you get to see published it's a it's an incredible honor so I get sent a lot of exercise ones and one of my favorite was the race trial it was probably one of the biggest studies coming across my career they took active surveillance patients in Edmonton in the\n University of Calgary and they've already it was one of the most widely read articles in medicine last year it was in Jama oncology and then there's another follow-up in the Journal of Urology and they just had them essentially do exercise a couple days a week they would come in versus a group that did not these aren't active surveillance not a hormone therapy and within 12 weeks not only their Fitness was so much better if you look at their level of anxiety and they're just fear of progression and just all of these\n fears that people have and stress all of those were reduced within 12 weeks and what struck me it was not the physical benefits that exercise brought them that is probably not what motivates me anymore and hopefully not for people going through hormone therapy the mental health benefits are striking they are so striking that you can literally tell the difference between two people who regularly exercise and not in just terms of mood in terms of stress anxiety something that doesn't get enough attention in cancer called\n catastrophizing catastrophizing is pervasive negative thinking where you get a piece of bad news and your mind goes oh my God my PSA higher I know the cancer is bad could this be metastatic disease it's all very understandable I had a I had a catastrophizing moment many weeks ago I had to go in for a early colonoscopy I'm not quite 60 I'm 58 which if you do the math is 10 years younger than Dr Scholl's which makes me incredibly happy sorry I had to throw that in because I think no the truth of the matter the truth of\n the matter is I had to go in there was an issue I thought oh my God here we go this is it God's been too good to me my whole life I'm going to pay the piper went through an extensive procedure it turned out to be fine they found a Paula but what I worried about wasn't what I worried about went and worked out had a good day and so what what working out does is it it reboots the brain so when you start to go into pervasive negative thinking it reboots you to think wait a second I'm good here and and that's why\n I'm saying that I just wish that the mental health benefits would be talked about even more than the physical health because as this is the challenge here as all of you go through these things it's so challenging and you know you have these moments you have these good moments and then you have these defeatist moments and there's and there's very little and when someone goes oh just buck up it's going to be fine hey you know that doesn't do it and you have to find internal ways internal\n circuitry to fix in order to get you to a better place and so one of the ways you reboot is through a robec activity resistance does it for some people but this is what they're finding in prostate cancer patients and I wish this would get a lot more attention because it keeps you in the game because whether things are going well or not unless you're okay here it's tough to see it right and this is why even if I talk to my son it doesn't matter who I'm talking to I always tell them to look\n for a partner that puts physical fitness at the Forefront I really think it's important for my your partnership I mean your partner is such a key person in your life as you're going through whatever you're going through one of the greatest things I love about my wife is since the day I met her is that she puts Fitness and taking care of herself at the front of everything anyone that knows her when she came to this meeting if it's eight nine nine thirty I'm in bed I'm not going to be drinking I'm\n going to do this I'm going to take care of myself I'm going to do a workout but not to the point of excessiveness and that stuff rubs off on me and back and forth and so another thing is you want to surround yourself they say you are who you surround yourself with and it's very true so when you're going through this to go back to your point what I commented to the researchers who are doing this trial is that you're not able to measure the benefit of what I call socialized exercise so if you're able to go with a trainer\n or you're able to go into a gym and you're around other people whether it's your partner or other men or women working out there's an added boost that we can't document in data but we know it exists because we learned that from depression studies if you take someone on antidepressants and they go into a social setting to work out they're more likely to get a better response from their antidepressant versus just working out in isolation so socialized exercise is another component if you can afford a trainer or\n a gym or you're going to go in and adopt a new attitude on taking care of yourself after today try to do it with a partner it is very powerful and it can get you away from what I call the stress the anxiety the depression the catastrophizing that occurs with dealing with trauma and dealing with cancer and dealing with the overwhelmingness of life and I hope you take some of that with you because that's what's helps sustain me through some of these storms when I dealt with it in my own family so for what it's worth\n um I'm glad we could emphasize it yeah the fitness side of things is uh life buffets us whether it's through cancer or other things and if we have a if we're for me if I'm able to exercise I um I have an exercise machine in my bedroom and every morning it looks at me asking me are you going to use me this morning and the days that I say yes I always wonder why did I even question it and the days that I say no yeah it's a it's it's a different day you never regret a workout after the workout is another\n thing after the workout it's not like I woke up at the hotel there's nobody in the exercise room at 6am let me tell you and I'm going what in the hell am I doing here and then you get into your routine and you know exactly why you're there because I love how movies and TV shows makes life seem like you're feeling one emotion for an entire year we are a vacillation of emotions but one of the ways we can control some of the negative thinking which we have to deal with and I also say this is one of the\n greatest problems that we've seen in kids getting rid of physical fitness in schools and now we know it hurts their science scores it hurts their math scores and it hurts their socialization and it hurts their mood it hurts their mood and it to me it was one of the biggest tragedies I've seen in this lifetime that when I had to get a physical fitness medal when I was in high school or Junior High that we abandoned that whole concept and now physical fitness is a dead concept as a class in school I think that was a huge\n mistake that will ultimately realize that we have to bring back so I'm talking about every single age group here being involved and there is a concept in medicine called the ripple effect it is a real real effect and any major exercise group has measured it including Weight Watchers and dieting groups the effect goes something like this when one person in a circle of people starts to take care of themselves better the chances that that behavior ripples to the rest of the people and they start paying attention to their\n health goes up dramatically so what they learned for example in a very famous Weight Watcher studies they gave free Weight Watchers to one partner they lost a bunch of weight they became healthier and they decided to look at the other partner that didn't get the Weight Watchers and suddenly they were becoming healthier for free because they were tagging along they were so excited about what their partner was doing so I could sit here for eight hours and go through the different benefits and I just love how people talk about these\n neurotransmitters serotonin they talk about dopamine exercise gives you all that it gives you that rush it gives you that effect and so but it is not easy I I don't even for a second try to Fathom What It's Like on hormone therapy It's just tough enough as I get older just to go out there and exercise because the motivation drops in fact they call hormone therapy I don't think I've shared this with you they called they call it officially Androgen deprivation treatment ADT I I think they should\n rename it to I came up with Androgen disposition transition meaning it changes personalities it makes you more tired it makes you more lethargic it's very hard to get motivated but I do think doing it with a partner asking for help is part of the way to get out of the gate and I hope I'm glad we sold it for 30 minutes here because it's so funny how we'll sit at these meetings and talk about the greatest drugs in the world for side effects and we haven't found a single drug that comes close to aerobic\n and resistance and flexibility exercises to combat most of the side effects of Androgen deprivation treatment we haven't we used to hear from Partners all the time my husband's different he's more labile he's more irritable on hormone therapy he's just different he snaps and you know we're just starting to learn about what happens physiologically and mood wise and so I'm hoping in the future we're selling this even more than we're selling it now to convince people I really am so do you\n want to say anything more about any other side effects should we call it a day we've had it we were good quite a day yeah I think that's it's good to close on that note the only thing I'd like to say is thank you again to the pcri team

here's a summary of the transcript with each topic separated:\nIntroduction The transcript is about the 2023 Mid-Year Prostate Cancer Patient Conference. The conference features doctors Mark Moyad and Mark Scholz, as well as the Prostate Cancer Research Institute.\nImportance of Screening Tools for Prostate Cancer The transcript emphasizes the importance of screening tools for prostate cancer. The Living with Cancer program is created to support people in their cancer journey, especially those facing challenges. Screening tools are discussed to help people live life beyond their diagnosis.\nImmunotherapy for Advanced Prostate Cancer The transcript discusses the use of immunotherapy, specifically Provenge, in treating advanced prostate cancer. Provenge is an established cellular immunotherapy used to treat certain men with advanced prostate cancer. It is customized to each individual by using his own immune cells. The immune system has memory and can recognize substances it has encountered previously, so immunotherapy is designed to boost the immune system to target and attack advanced prostate cancer.\nSafety Information for Provenge The transcript provides important safety information for Provenge. Before receiving Provenge, patients should tell their doctor about any medical conditions, including heart or lung problems, or if they have had a stroke. They should also inform their doctor about any medications they take, including prescription and non-prescription drugs, vitamins, or dietary supplements. The most common side effects of Provenge include chills, fatigue, fever, back pain, nausea, joint ache, and headache. Patients should also be aware that Provenge infusion can cause serious reactions, and they should tell their doctor right away if they have signs of a heart attack or lung problems, such as trouble breathing, chest pains, racing or irregular heartbeats, high or low blood pressure, dizziness, fainting, nausea or vomiting, or signs of a stroke, such as numbness or weakness on one side of the body, decreased vision in one eye, or difficulty speaking.\nVarious Aspects of Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment The transcript covers various aspects of prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment, including imaging techniques, genetic counseling, and exercise and diet recommendations.\nImaging Techniques The conference discusses imaging techniques, particularly PSMA PET scans. PSMA PET scans can be used to assess the extent of the disease after diagnosis and after treatments, which is called staging and restaging. They can also identify the source of rising PSA, a big problem for prostate cancer patients. PSMA PET scans should be reimbursed at any stage of the disease, except they cannot be used to diagnose prostate cancer.\nGenetic Counseling The conference also emphasizes the importance of genetic counseling for patients with prostate cancer. There are genetic counselors available to help patients understand whether they may pass on the disease to their children.\nExercise and Diet Recommendations The conference discusses the importance of exercise and diet for prostate cancer patients. Patients who eat healthier and have a higher quality diet have a higher chance of improved bone health, even though they are not necessarily getting more calcium and vitamin D. The conference emphasizes the importance of hydration, and recommends that patients try to stay hydrated as they get older.\nUse of PSMA PET Scans to Replace Biopsies and Modify Hormone Therapy Duration The conference discusses the potential use of PSMA PET scans to replace biopsies and modify hormone therapy duration. PSMA PET scans may be able to replace biopsies in someone that has an abnormal PSA. Additionally, PSMA PET scans may modify the duration of hormone therapy, and this aspect of the scans is being studied.\nIn conclusion, the 2023 Mid-Year Prostate Cancer Patient Conference covers various important topics related to prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. The conference emphasizes the importance of screening", "metaData": {"source": "2023 Mid-Year #ProstateCancer Patient Conference | #MarkMoyadMD #MarkScholzMD #PCRI - YouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTqPnSRYtW4"}}
