{"pageContent": "This article aimed to review the clinical application and evidence of the therapeutic ultrasound in detail for urological diseases such as prostate cancer, kidney tumor, erectile dysfunction, and urolithiasis. We searched for articles about high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), extracorporeal shock wave therapy, ultrasound lithotripsy, and extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) in the MEDLINE and Embase. HIFU may be indicated as a primary treatment for low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer, and salvage therapy for local recurrence as a promising way to address the limitations of current standard therapies. The application of HIFU in treating kidney tumors has scarcely been reported with unsatisfactory results. Evidence indicates that low-intensity shockwave therapy improves subjective and objective erectile function in patients with erectile dysfunction. Regarding the application of ultrasound in stone management, the novel combination of ultrasound lithotripsy and other energy sources in a single probe promises to be a game-changer in efficiently disintegrating large kidney stones in percutaneous nephrolithotomy. ESWL is losing its role in managing upper urinary tract calculi worldwide. The burst-wave lithotripsy and ultrasound propulsion could be the new hope to regain its position in the lithotripsy field. According to our investigations and reviews, cavitation bubbles of the therapeutic ultrasound are actively being used in the field of urology. Although clinical evidence has been accumulated in urological diseases such as prostate cancer, kidney tumor, erectile dysfunction, and lithotripsy, further development is needed to be a game-changer in treating these diseases.", "metaData": {"source": "Magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate after focal therapy with high-intensity focused ultrasound\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32447414/"}}
