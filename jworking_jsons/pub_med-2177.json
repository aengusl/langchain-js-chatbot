{"pageContent": "High-grade prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) is the most likely precancerous lesion for prostatic carcinoma. A high incidence of its association with cancer has been reported in Western countries. On the other hand, information regarding its incidence is limited in Japan, where the mortality due to prostate cancer is much lower. We reviewed 53 clinical stage T2 or T3 prostatic cancers of Japanese patients living in Osaka, Japan (mean age, 67.2 years). These cases were subdivided into a pre-operatively non-castrated group (34 cases) and a medically or surgically castrated group (19 cases). HGPIN was found in 27 cases. The incidence of HGPIN was significantly lower in the castrated group (21.0%) compared with the non-castrated group (67.6%). In the non-castrated group, patient age, pathological stage, Gleason score, tumor size and serum prostate-specific antigen showed no significant correlation with HGPIN. Advanced pathological stage and tumor size tended to decrease the incidence of HGPIN, although this was not statistically significant. When the study group was limited to stage T2 tumors of the non-castrated group, the incidence of HGPIN was 81.0%. HGPIN in Japan may also be clinically and etiologically significant as a precursor of clinical cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer and black men\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9858323/"}}
