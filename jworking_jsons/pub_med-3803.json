{"pageContent": "Each of the three most common contemporary treatments for localized prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, and brachytherapy, can have adverse effects on sexual health. Sexual health outcome can be improved by treatment-specific factors, such as the use of nerve-sparing technique during radical prostatectomy, or worsened by the use of androgen deprivation before external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy.
