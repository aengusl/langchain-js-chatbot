{"pageContent": "The diagnosis of prostate cancer at any age can strike fear in a man and his family. One treatment for early stage prostate cancer that is gaining renewed popularity is ultrasonically guided permanent iodine-125 or palladium-103 interstitial brachytherapy or seed implantation. This procedure permits concentrated, accurate radiation to the prostate while reducing the probability of radiation injury to adjacent tissue. A well-tolerated outpatient procedure, it is associated with negligible complications, and is the most overall cost-effective treatment option for early stage prostate cancer today. Nurses who are knowledgeable about the treatment plan and procedure play a pivotal role in teaching, preparing, and caring for patients during all phases of the treatment process. Their care and reassurance help reduce anxiety for patients and families during a difficult time in their lives.", "metaData": {"source": "Treatments for improving survival of patients with prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12831292/"}}
