{"pageContent": "Introduction: Focal therapy offers the possibility of cancer control, without the side effect profile of radical therapies. Early single centre prospective development studies using high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) have demonstrated encouraging genitourinary functional preservation and short-term cancer control. Large multi-centre trials are required to evaluate medium-term cancer control and reproduce functional recovery. We describe the study design of an investigator-led UK multi-centre, single arm trial using HIFU to deliver focal therapy for men with localised prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "[Scientific evidence on the use of high-intensity focal ultrasound (HIFU) in the treatment of prostatic carcinoma]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15881912/"}}
