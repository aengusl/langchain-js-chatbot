Development in spiral upwards could only result from discussion based on evidence. We have not yet been able to achieve a primary prevention of the disease. Much information is promising and doubtlessly represents large potential. As the detection of cases in the early stage increases, the diagnosis of less aggressive or non aggressive forms, that need not to be radically treated, increases as well. We have a chance, though still limited, to differentiate forms of the disease more precisely than whenever before and the precise diagnostics should be included into the daily clinical practice.
