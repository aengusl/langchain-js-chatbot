{"pageContent": "The first radical prostatectomy was performed in 1904. Since then, it has become one of the main treatment options for patients with prostate cancer, especially those with organ-confined disease. As it is the case in all types of malignancies, the treatment choice for the patient with prostate cancer depends on several considerations, the most important of which is the ability of the treatment modality to control disease. This review provides a brief comparison between radical prostatectomy and other main treatment options of prostate cancer, such as \"watchful waiting\" and radiation therapy, in terms of cancer control.
