{"pageContent": "Background: High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a new modality that can be used for local tumor ablation therapy. In the present study, the expression of human checkpoint kinase2 (Chk2), which may have significant roles in the response to DNA damage after HIFU treatment for prostate cancer, was examined.", "metaData": {"source": "MR-Guided High-Intensity Directional Ultrasound Ablation of Prostate Cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33403460/"}}
