{"pageContent": "The place of endocrine therapy, either alone or in combination with radiotherapy and surgery, remains highly controversial in the treatment of non-metastatic prostate cancer. The authors review the results of isolated endocrine therapy or associated with local therapy. At the present time, there are few arguments in favour of the use of endocrine therapy in the following situations: isolated treatment of localized or locally advanced cancer prior to radical prostatectomy, after radical prostatectomy. Current data suggest a benefit of endocrine therapy in combination with radiotherapy in patients with high-grade localized or locally advanced cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "WNT signalling in prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28895566/"}}
