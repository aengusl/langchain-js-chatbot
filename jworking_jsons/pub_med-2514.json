{"pageContent": "Background: The dietary consumption of high levels of soy has been linked to reduced risks for prostate cancer (PC) in Asians and vegetarians. In vitro studies have focused on the two most abundant isoflavones in soy, genistein and daidzein. However, daidzein is differentially metabolized by gut microflora in humans, yielding compounds with very different bioactivities and half-lives. Asians are significantly more likely to produce the metabolite equol than Caucasians, suggesting its role in the prevention of PC. We hypothesize that equol is a bioactive metabolite that exerts direct antiproliferative effects on prostatic epithelial cells.", "metaData": {"source": "Comparative immuno-Cerenkov luminescence and -PET imaging enables detection of PSMA+ tumors in mice using 64Cu-radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30445280/"}}
