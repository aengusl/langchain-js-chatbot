{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among American men and is the third leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Over the past few years, significant advances (e.g. improved prostatic ultrasonography and the discovery of serum prostate-specific antigen) have made it possible to detect prostate cancer at an early stage. In addition, refinements in the treatment both of localized disease (by nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy) and of advanced disease (by novel forms of hormonal therapy) have improved the outlook and quality of life for men with prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Comparative effectiveness of aggressive versus nonaggressive treatment among men with early-stage prostate cancer and differing comorbid disease burdens at diagnosis\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24824511/"}}
