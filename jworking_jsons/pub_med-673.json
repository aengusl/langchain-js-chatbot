{"pageContent": "Purpose of review: Options for prostate cancer management are rapidly expanding. The recent advent of MRI technology has led to guided prostate biopsies by radiologists working in-bore or by urologists using MR/US fusion technology. The resulting tumor visualization now provides the option of focal therapy. Currently available are highly directed energies - focused ultrasound (HIFU), cryotherapy, and laser - all offering the hope of curing prostate cancer with few side effects.", "metaData": {"source": "Can residents perform transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy with patient comfort comparable to biopsy performed by attending staff urologists?\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19770843/"}}
