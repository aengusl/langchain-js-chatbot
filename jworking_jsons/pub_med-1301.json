{"pageContent": "Urinary and sexual function and bother are important outcomes following radical prostatectomy (RP). Since urinary and sexual function are age-related, post-operative bother may vary by age. This study explores the disease-specific quality-of-life outcomes in young men compared with older men undergoing RP. Using CaPSURE data, we identified men who underwent RP and completed the UCLA Prostate Cancer Index (PCI) before and 1-year post-RP. Men were stratified by age (< 55 years, 55-64, > or = 65). Multivariate regression models were created: a linear model for predictors of PCI scores and a logistic model for predictors of severe declines in PCI domains. Younger men scored significantly better than older men in urinary function (P=0.04), urinary bother (P=0.02) and sexual function (P<0.0001) 1-year post-RP. Severe declines in urinary bother (odds ratio (OR)=1.54, 1.01-2.35) and sexual function (OR=3.20, 1.97-5.19) were more common in men > or = 65 years. Men with relationships had less urinary bother (P=0.03) and were less likely to experience severe worsening of urinary bother (OR=0.32, 0.17-0.60) while having a greater risk of severe worsening of sexual bother (OR=2.74, 1.28-5.89). The use of sexual aids was associated with worse sexual bother (P<0.0001) and greater risk of severe worsening of sexual bother (OR=2.29, 1.54-3.30). Baseline PCI scores were independent predictors in all models. One year after RP, younger men (age < 55) have similar, or better, urinary and sexual function and bother. Baseline scores are strongly associated with post-RP scores and severity of declines. Current relationships and use of sexual aids have significant roles in post-RP bother.", "metaData": {"source": "A randomized trial of external beam radiotherapy versus cryoablation in patients with localized prostate cancer: quality of life outcomes\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19691092/"}}
