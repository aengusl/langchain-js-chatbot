{"pageContent": "Men with locally advanced prostate cancer face a high risk of disease progression and cancer-related death. The traditional active treatment options for locally advanced disease, either following failure of treatment of primary curative intent or newly diagnosed, are radiotherapy and castration. Radiotherapy alone has a high failure rate, although outcome can be improved by adjuvant hormonal therapy. Castration is associated with loss of libido, sexual dysfunction, osteoporosis and hot flushes, which are significant drawbacks when patients may receive treatment for several years. Monotherapy with a non-steroidal antiandrogen offers potential benefits with respect to quality of life. Studies in the adjuvant setting are in progress. In the setting of previously untreated locally advanced disease, pooled mature data (56% deaths) from two major studies indicate no significant difference in survival outcome between bicalutamide ('Casodex') 150 mg and castration. Bicalutamide 150 mg offers quality of life benefits with respect to sexual interest and physical capacity. Preliminary data suggest that bicalutamide maintains bone mineral density. Bicalutamide 150 mg is well tolerated; gynaecomastia and breast pain, common side effects of antiandrogen monotherapy, may be managed by prophylactic irradiation or surgery. Bicalutamide 150 mg monotherapy is an alternative to castration for locally advanced prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Management of prostate cancer in HIV-positive patients\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20421876/"}}
