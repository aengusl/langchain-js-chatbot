{"pageContent": "Radiotherapy is a valid curative alternative to surgery for prostate cancer. However, patient selection is critical to ensure patients obtain benefits from therapy delivered with curative intent. Dose-escalated radiation has been shown to improve patient outcomes, facilitated by development of robust image guidance and better target delineation imaging technologies. These concepts have also rekindled interest in hypofractionated radiotherapy in the forms of stereotactic body radiotherapy and brachytherapy. Postprostatectomy radiotherapy also improves long-term biochemical outcome in men at high risk of local recurrence.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer: radioresistance molecular target-related markers and foreseeable modalities of radiosensitization\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25219826/"}}
