{"pageContent": "Background: Irreversible electroporation (IRE) delivers brief electric pulses to attain non-thermal focal ablation that spares vasculature and other sensitive systems. It is a promising prostate cancer treatment due to sparing of the tissues associated with morbidity risk from conventional therapies. IRE effects depend on electric field strength and tissue properties. These characteristics are organ-dependent, affecting IRE treatment outcomes. This study characterizes the relevant properties to improve treatment planning and outcome predictions for IRE prostate cancer treatment.", "metaData": {"source": "Radiation-induced apoptosis: predictive and therapeutic significance in radiotherapy of prostate cancer (review)\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10854529/"}}
