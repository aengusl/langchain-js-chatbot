{"pageContent": "Background: Surgery is the only curative treatment in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM), but only 10-20% of patients are eligible. High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) technology is of proven value in several indications, notably prostate cancer. Its intra-operative use in patients with CLM has not previously been studied. Preclinical work suggested the safety and feasibility of a new HIFU device capable of ablating volumes of up to 2cm x 2cm in a few seconds.", "metaData": {"source": "Re: High Intensity Focused Ultrasound Hemigland Ablation for Prostate Cancer.
