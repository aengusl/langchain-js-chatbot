{"pageContent": "At the time of diagnosis, prostate cancer is organ confined in 70% of the cases. Of these patients, 25% undergo local therapy (surgery/radiation), and 75% risk disease progression by \"watchful waiting\" or systemic side effects through hormonal ablation. Local high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for minimal invasive tissue coagulation (85 degrees C) ablates prostatic tissue with high precision. Follow-up sextant biopsies (1.9) showed 80% of the patients to be cancer free. In those cases with residual cancer, the tumor mass was reduced by more than 90%. The PSA nadir in 97% was < 4 ng/ml, including 61% < 0.5 ng/ml. After primary HIFU, no severe side effects occurred (no fistula, no grade II/III incontinence, no rectal mucosa burn). As auxiliary treatments, all patients received a suprapubic tube (29 days), and 33% needed a transurethral debris resection (TUR 7 g). The patients were released from the hospital within 24 h after treatment. According to the short-term follow-up, transrectal HIFU enables minimal invasive local prostate tissue ablation with high rates of negative biopsies, low PSA nadir, and low complication rate.", "metaData": {"source": "Utilization of multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging in clinical practice and focal therapy: report from a Delphi consensus project\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27637908/"}}
