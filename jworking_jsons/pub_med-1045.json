{"pageContent": "This article evaluates current sexual functioning in patients with prostate cancer who are awaiting treatment. One-hundred fifty-eight patients filled out a 15-item questionnaire regarding current sexual functioning. Median age was 67 years. Sixty percent reported to have spontaneous erections at least once a week, and 37% reported a good firmness. Thirty-five percent reported that during sexual activity they had no difficulty in getting erections, and 33% reported that they had no difficulty in maintaining an erection. After diagnosis, all patients reported a decrease in sexual interest, activity, and pleasure. Diagnosis of prostate cancer does have an impact on sexual functioning, therefore sexual counseling prior to treatment is advised.", "metaData": {"source": "Communication and intimacy-enhancing interventions for men diagnosed with prostate cancer and their partners\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23387918/"}}
