{"pageContent": "Locally advanced prostate cancer is diagnosed in approximately one in four new cases of prostate cancer. The estimated disease-specific mortality rate resulting from monotherapy with either surgery or radiotherapy is a disappointing 75%. A multimodality treatment approach could offer more promising results. In addition, several key factors related to surgical treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer may optimize the oncologic results and minimize patient morbidity. In this report, we summarize some of the anatomic features and technical concepts associated with the surgical management of this disease and review recently published results of the outcomes of surgery and neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemohormonal therapy for locally advanced prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Cohort profile: the TrueNTH Global Registry - an international registry to monitor and improve localised prostate cancer health outcomes\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29183925/"}}
