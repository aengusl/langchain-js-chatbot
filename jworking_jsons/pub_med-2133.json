{"pageContent": "In a multicentre study, 101 consecutive patients with advanced prostate cancer were offered the choice of orchiectomy or treatment with an LHRH analogue. Together with the cancer diagnosis the patients were given verbal information about the treatment alternatives, and detailed written information to peruse at home. One week later the patients informed the attending physicians of their choice. Information as to the reasons for the patients' choice, and their views on their choice after the start of treatment were elicited by questionnaire. Of the 101 patients, 48 chose orchiectomy, and 48 treatment with an LHRH analogue, five patients being excluded owing to their inability to decide. Mean age was about 73 years in both treatment groups, and about two thirds of each group lived with a partner. The level of education was higher among those who chose medical treatment. The predominant reasons for the choice of treatment were as follows: Orchiectomy, simpler (31 per cent), troublesome having to have monthly injections (19 per cent), simple to perform (15 per cent); medical treatment, possibility of change in treatment (27 per cent), simpler (17 per cent), fear of surgery (15 per cent). Most patients in both groups had no difficulty deciding, chose quickly, felt sure about their choice, appreciated the opportunity of choosing, and had discussed their choice with their partners or intimates. Three months after the start of treatment, almost all patients were still satisfied with their choice, and had no wish to change their choice even if that were possible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "metaData": {"source": "Androgen receptor gene amplification: a novel molecular mechanism for endocrine therapy resistance in human prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8981668/"}}
