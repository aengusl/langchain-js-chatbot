{"pageContent": " foreign today we're going to be talking about hormone therapy and radiation so the first question we have is from a patient who is concerned that after radiation the chances of you know secondary cancers such as you know bowel or bladder cancer can go up from they heard it could go up from one percent to 50 over five years and they're wondering is this true that's certainly not true but the question is a good question because uh we know radiation could in theory cause secondary cancers the technology\n has gotten so much better now the radiation that we target let's say at the prostate for example is very focused and the doses are so high there's no cells left over that could mutate into another type of cancer but at the edge of the radiation especially with older radiation the the transition from where the spot is being radiated to the areas around there that aren't being radiated was more of a gradation and at some point there was high radiation doses that weren't powerful enough to eradicate the cells altogether and in\n theory some of those could convert and mutate into another type of cancer and for where we're treating the prostate you mentioned the bladder and the bowel which were very close with a much more accurate radiation with Technologies like space or the chances for secondary tumors is very very rare we've been uh following patients now more than 20 years I have seen one case of what I think was a secondary rectal tumor from a poorly performed type of radiation many many years ago but it's it's extremely uncommon and the better\n technology we have today I think almost eliminates this concern it'll never be completely gone but it's way way less than one percent risk and uh and that idea that people are inevitably uh destined to getting secondary tumors is really ludicrous so you mentioned space War can you explain is space War something that every radiation oncologist uses is this something that's widespread or is it something a patient would have to ask for not quite sure I tend to refer to select centers where space wars used routinely but whether it\n is been adopted widely across the country I'm not sure it's something that people should ask for because it pushes the rectal wall out of the radiation field and eliminates the risk for serious proctitis inflammation of the rectal wall which used to be a rare but very very devastating side effect so it's something probably that should come up in conversation when patients are talking about radiation with their radiation therapists and or you know it it's about 30 minutes to put in prior to the treatment correct\n yeah it doesn't have to be put in at exactly the time of the treatment it can be done in a different day but it's yeah it's installed in a brief procedure and do they use a painkiller at all or anesthetic or anything to help with that um but novocaine on the skin where it's injected to the skin of the perineum into the right behind the prostate it's it's a little uncomfortable but prevents the possibility of long-term damage which makes it more than worthwhile and how long does it take to dissolve so it\n stays in place for about 90 days and then it converts into water and disappears completely so we have a patient who just finished radiation and hormone therapy and now they're wondering if they can take a testosterone booster taking testosterone after hormone therapy is that safe well if you think about it men who are stopping hormone therapy which blocks out their testosterone are taking testosterone although it's coming from their own testicles it's not coming from a cream or a shot and this question\n comes up quite a bit because some uh and especially an elderly men if they've been taking Lupron for a long time the recovery of the testicles can be very delayed or sometimes you can be left with permanent low testosterone for the rest of your life so taking testosterone is a natural question in these people because we know from studies that after a certain period of time probably 18 months or so you're not getting any additional anti-cancer efficacy in men that have been left in this sort of destitute state with no\n testosterone why not give them some testosterone to restore the normal the normal Milo in their body and there's really no arguments against it because it's exactly the same testosterone that comes from the testicle there's no difference the use of testosterone as say an injection or a cream will sometimes cause excess production of red cells so it's a completely separate issue from what people normally think about they're worried about the cancer coming back and and now with psma pet scans I mean maybe\n it's good to find these spots early and and address them but the real concern is not the cancer coming back because we can monitor for that and act accordingly if it does come back and the testosterone doesn't promote uh you know more cancer coming back it may reveal it if it's there but it doesn't cause the cancer to come back the real issue is that the red cells if they're are indeed produced in excess can cause predisposed people to heart attacks and strokes and this is well reported in the testosterone industry it\n doesn't have anything to do with prostate cancer so I always caution people that if they are taking testosterone that they need to monitor monitor their CBC and their hematocrit levels and if their red cells become if they do start to produce excessively that they get either donate blood or reduce the dose of testosterone but most importantly that they monitor for high red blood cell levels how often do they need to monitor for uh when you're first starting off you want to check it probably every six weeks a couple times\n and then if everything's stable every three months a couple times and then after that probably at least twice a year do they need to go to their you know family physician for this or can they just go to a lab and check their levels well a doctor has to order these blood tests so whether it's a family physician or their oncologist whoever's prescribing the testosterone will usually be Savvy about this sort of issue but it's good for the patients to be aware of it as well so we have a question from a\n person in Spain and they have glycinate prostate cancer they have a metastasis on their lumbar spine and on their pelvic region and their doctors have prescribed casodex and Lupron and he's concerned because nobody's prescribing radiation to take care of the spots is this typical I know he's in a different country maybe it's treated differently in the U.\n S what would you do well this comes up to the rich and evolving area of what we call oligo metastatic prostate cancer oligo in Greek means few and historically the idea of zapping spots on the bones with radiation was considered inappropriate and there was a no conviction in the medical world that that would be helpful the thought was that there's cancer everywhere that's just the tip of the iceberg and you're you know lopping off the tops of icebergs but the iceberg's not going away there's going to be more cancer coming back later that thinking has\n changed a lot for several reasons one is that the scans have gotten better in the old days the scans were very poor and so you were just seeing the tip of the iceberg but modern scans are seeing perhaps most or all of the cancer and so since it's easy to radiate these spots and sterilize them why not and studies are coming out now to confirm that the people that do radiate these spots do better long term than the people that don't do it so there isn't much downside it's not going to lead to a cure in\n everybody but in a few people it will lead to a cure and the radiation since it doesn't have many side effects you definitely would would want to do it we don't know what kind of quality scans are getting over there in Spain but uh it's certainly reasonable to have a discussion with the doctor about the possibility of radiating these metastatic spots so this is more of a statement that comment on our YouTube but I thought it was an interesting concept so there was a patient who had proton therapy and\n four months out there having really good urinary flow they're taking Flomax once a day and they're not having many urinary issues and they think it's because they chose proton therapy so is that true that it would be proton therapy versus any other type of radiation uh but no probably not true the way I conceive of proton therapy is like uh a a methodology that's very similar to other state-of-the-art forms of radiation uh no and no worse or no better can men go through radiation without any undue\n urinary problems yes all the time that's not at all surprising so I don't think that it was specifically because he had proton therapy and it may not be because he specifically had radiation some men will notice Improvement in urinary function after radiation because their prostate will shrink a little bit other men will have no change other men will have some increased problems due to inflammation of the urethra so I think that the fears that radiation was going to transpose into long-term urinary problems have been quelled a lot\n with improved techniques also I'm seeing with seed implant radiation where they're able to keep the radiation off the urethra these men seem to do better than what we historically expected with radiation treatments but no I don't think it's specifically the proton therapy itself even though that is a good type of radiation so we have a patient who's 62 years old they're newly diagnosed and they have a PSA of about 13 and their Gleason score is three plus four and they've been given three options for\n treatment now the great thing about this patient is it sounds like they've gotten multiple opinions so their urologist told them surgery and then they saw a couple radiation oncologists and they suggested either external beam radiation or brachytherapy so given the situation what would you have them choose well we'd need a lot more information there are many types of three plus four with a PSA of 13 it sounds like well you're inevitably forced to have treatment but some men with really large prostates are\n going to have a PSA of 13 with no cancer at all so we don't know how big this prostate is we don't know if it's on one side or both sides so in men that have unilateral disease focal therapy is very attractive because the incidence of erectile dysfunction is much less we don't know if this man is highly motivated to preserve sexual function most 62 year olds will be very motivated to preserve sexual function so so some form of focal therapy which can be done with radiation or brachytherapy or other\n methodologies like haifu or laser or electroporation cryotherapy all those things would be consideration so I do tend to shy away from surgery in general because surgery is accompanied by problems with urinary incontinence which doesn't occur if it does it's very very rare with radiation and then of course all men after surgery become impotent and then a percentage of them recover which is uh rather rather daunting Prospect back so surgery is not an attractive option for me in this modern era but the details of this\n gentleman's case are spotty and especially with three plus four you're looking at some men might even be able to do active surveillance do focal therapy and if it just comes down to the three options that we've been offered brachytherapy would be my preferred approach as long as the prostate is not too large and and same thing for radiation if the prostate's very very big then radiation became become more difficult and then focal therapy even becomes a more attractive option for those people thank you so much for watching this\n video on radiation and hormone therapy we know that you are facing many decisions regarding to what type of treatment you're choosing and we are here to help you research your research is going to be the biggest factor in making the right decision for you and we thank you for allowing us to be here if you have any questions or comments you can go ahead and leave them in the comment section below this video we hope you have a great week thank you for trusting us and much love thank you foreign\nSUMMARY \nRadiation therapy for prostate cancer has become more precise and has a lower risk of secondary cancers.\nSpaceOAR is a technology that can be used to push the rectal wall out of the radiation field, reducing the risk of rectal inflammation.\nTaking testosterone after hormone therapy can be safe and may help restore normal levels, but excessive production of red blood cells can be a concern.\nRadiating metastatic spots in oligometastatic prostate cancer can lead to better outcomes and is generally safe.\nTreatment options for prostate cancer vary depending on individual cases and may include surgery, radiation, or focal therapy such as brachytherapy.", "metaData": {"source": "Radiation and Hormone Therapy | Prostate Cancer | Mark Scholz, MD | PCRI -
