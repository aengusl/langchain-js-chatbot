{"pageContent": "To compare diagnostic value of transrectal prostatic biopsy in obtaining samples of tissue from different sites in patients with various levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostate size, we made primary transrectal biopsy of the prostate in 486 patients. The patients were divided into 7 groups by the number of punctures at biopsy (from 6 to 18). Among the patients with PSA under 20 ng/ml in the number of tissue biopsy samples 18, a rise in prostatic cancer detection rate (PCDR) was 16.6%. In PSA above 20 ng/ml, a statistically significant maximal rise in PCDR occurred in the increase of biopsy number from 6 to 12 (by 9.3%). The number of local cancer forms in patients with PSA < 20 ng/ml among all the detected cases rose from 70% (biopsy from 6 sites) to 92.3% (biopsy from 18 sites). Among the patients with PSA < 20 ng/ml and the size of the prostate > 50 sm3, a significant rise of PCDR increased from 20 to 33.3% in an increase of the puncture number from 6 to 12. In the group of patients with the same PSA level and prostate > 50 cm3 PCDR improves in biopsy from 14, 16 and 18 sites (from 12.1 to 27.7%, 28.5 to 33.3%, respectively). Standard biopsy is insufficient for adequate PCDR, it is necessary to obtain samples of tissue from a large number of sites with puncture of peripheral zone of the prostate. Transrectal biopsy of the prostate according to the extended method improves PCDR, primarily, in local cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Development of a Nationally Representative Coordinated Registry Network for Prostate Ablation Technologies\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29307684/"}}
