{"pageContent": "A novel experimental method was developed to study the origin of the voltammetric response of human prostate cancer (PC-3) cell suspension as a model in consideration of the biological characters of living cells. The presence of guanine and xanthine in the cell eluent secreted by the living cells was verified by HPLC assay with a DAD system and chemometric method. Comparative studies of voltammetric behaviors of the PC-3 cell suspension, the PC-3 cell eluent, and the PC-3 cell sediment re-suspension showed that the voltammetric response of the PC-3 cells was given by xanthine and guanine bases in the PC-3 cell eluent, not by the cells. Linear relationship between the peak currents of guanine and xanthine in the cell eluent and the cell concentrations was found. Other factors, such as the cell secretion time and the immersion time of the multiwalled carbon nanotubes modified glassy carbon electrode (MWCNTs-modified GCE) in the cell eluent, also influenced the intensity of the peak currents. The biochemical mechanisms of the voltammetric behavior for the cell suspension were proposed.", "metaData": {"source": "Men's strategies for preserving emotional well-being in advanced prostate cancer: An interpretative phenomenological analysis\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25871263/"}}
