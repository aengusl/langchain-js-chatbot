{"pageContent": "Treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer remains controversial. Treatment options include radical prostatectomy (PR), radiotherapy (RT) and hormonotherapy (HT). A Medline database search with key words \"prostate cancer\", \"locally advanced\", \"high risk\" and \"treatment\" in articles published during the last 15 years was done. Fifty one out of 329 papers were selected and reviewed. Selection criteria were a minimum of scientific evidence level of IIa, except for some specific level IV reference. Numerous randomized studies show that patients may benefit of a combined therapy with RT and HT. RP has shown its usefulness in selected cases of locally advanced prostate cancer. Results of long follow-up series are similar to those obtained with RT and HT. Furthermore, the possibility of clinical over staging is an argument in favour of RP. We perform an updated revision of every possible choice available in the treatment of these tumours.", "metaData": {"source": "Androgen deprivation therapy use with post-prostatectomy radiotherapy in the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Registry Victoria\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30295411/"}}
