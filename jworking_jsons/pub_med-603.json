{"pageContent": "Multiple treatments are proposed to cure prostate carcinoma. Radical prostatectomy is the classical option for localized tumor. However radiotherapy can be proposed in such circumstances with the argument of a less invasive procedure with similar results. High Intensity Focalised Ultrasound (HIFU) is a new technique available for similar staging of the carcinoma with good results. Follow up is based on biological evaluation of PSA. Imaging studies are required only in cases of abnormal level. Endorectal Ultrasonography with biopsies is useful after radical surgery. Indications for MRI study is mainly to differentiate a localized from a general recurrence.", "metaData": {"source": "Three-dimensional greyscale transrectal ultrasound-guidance and biopsy core preembedding for detection of prostate cancer: Dutch clinical cohort study\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30991993/"}}
