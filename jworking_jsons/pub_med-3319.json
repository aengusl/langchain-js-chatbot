{"pageContent": "The incidence of organ-confined and early-stage prostate cancer has increased. The external beam radiation therapy has proven to be a good therapeutic option in terms of biochemical survival and overall survival. It has been modified throughout the years; consequently, the available data on the long-term efficacy of external beam radiation therapy are difficult to compare with the commonly used improved radiation strategies. Intensity-modulated conformal radiotherapy and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy result in better tumor control at a lower complication rate. External beam radiotherapy seems to be favored in intermediate- and high-risk groups for relapse of prostate cancer and radical prostatectomy is favored in the low-risk group. However, they score similarly in terms of general health-related quality of life after treatment.", "metaData": {"source": "Radical Prostatectomy for High-risk Localized or Node-Positive Prostate Cancer: Removing the Primary\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28589400/"}}
