{"pageContent": "The aim of this study was to assess the treatment patterns and 3-12-month complication rates associated with receiving prostate cryotherapy in a population-based study. Men >65 years diagnosed with incident localized prostate cancer in Surveillance Epidemiology End Results (SEER)-Medicare-linked database from 2004 to 2005 were identified. A total of 21,344 men were included in the study, of which 380 were treated initially with cryotherapy. Recipients of cryotherapy versus aggressive forms of prostate therapy (ie, radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy) were more likely to be older, have one co-morbidity, low income, live in the South and be diagnosed with indolent cancer. Complication rates increased from 3 to 12 months following cryotherapy. By the twelfth month, the rates for urinary incontinence, lower urinary tract obstruction, erectile dysfunction and bowel bleeding reached 9.8, 28.7, 20.1 and 3.3%, respectively. Diagnoses of hydronephrosis, urinary fistula or bowel fistula were not evident. The rates of corrective invasive procedures for lower urinary tract obstruction and erectile dysfunction were both <2.9% by the twelfth month. Overall, complications post-cryotherapy were modest; however, diagnoses for lower urinary tract obstruction and erectile dysfunction were common.", "metaData": {"source": "The effect of dyadic intervention on self-efficacy, social support, and depression for men with prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14745745/"}}
