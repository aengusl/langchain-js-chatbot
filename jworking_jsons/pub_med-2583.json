{"pageContent": "Focal treatment for prostate cancer has been proposed as an innovative strategy that aims to achieve oncological benefit while reducing treatment-related morbidity. This treatment is suitable for patients with low and intermediate risk, organ-confined disease. Focal therapy can be categorized as follows: unifocal index lesion ablation, multifocal ablation, hemi-gland ablation or subtotal gland ablation. Different types of energies are applied in focal therapy including high intensity focal ultrasound (HIFU), cryotherapy, focal laser ablation (FLA), irreversible electroporation (IRE) and Photodynamic therapy (PDT). In this review we will briefly present a summary of leading techniques and the available data regarding their oncological outcomes and adverse events. Whole-gland therapies were excluded from this review.", "metaData": {"source": "Analysis of quality of life and late biochemical predictors for localized cancer recurrence following radical prostatectomy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31463559/"}}
