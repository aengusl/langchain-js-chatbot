{"pageContent": "Despite recent advances, current diagnostic tests and treatment of prostate cancer have limitations. In the last few years, numerous biomolecules have been investigated with the aim of improving diagnosis, including kallikrein-like proteases, growth factors and neuroendocrine markers. Analysis of susceptibility genes has also been a focus of attention. Extensive research into new therapeutic approaches is also underway, including targeting angiogenesis, immune regulation and stromal-epithelial interactions. Gene therapy, gene chip technology and proteomics have emerged as promising innovations. The host of novel diagnostic markers and therapies require appropriate validation, both phenotypical and functional. A further consideration is the need to re-evaluate clinical trial design and end points to facilitate progression of promising targets through the clinical trial process. Overall, the outlook for the treatment of prostate cancer looks promising, with any advances likely to require both a multimodal and multidisciplinary approach.", "metaData": {"source": "[Prostate cancer stem cells: advances in current research]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25796694/"}}
