{"pageContent": "Objectives: Cancer screening exists to save lives. However, the mortality-reducing effect of prostate cancer screening has not yet been sufficiently demonstrated. Therefore, screening should only be performed in men well informed about the disease. We hypothesized that having sufficient information will reduce men's desire for screening. To verify this hypothesis, we measured the willingness to pay (WTP) for prostate-specific antigen screening using the contingent valuation method.", "metaData": {"source": "Context-dependent effects of genome-wide association study genotypes and macroenvironment on time to biochemical (prostate specific antigen) failure after prostatectomy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20826827/"}}
