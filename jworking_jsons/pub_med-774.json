{"pageContent": "Background: High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a novel method which offers the non-invasive ablation of tissues without harming overlying organs or skin. It has been introduced successfully in urology for the ablation of prostatic hyperplasia and seems to be promising in the treatment of uterine fibroids. In this study we aimed to examine the feasibility and possible side effects of HIFU treatment of uterine tissues using an experimental mobile HIFU unit with ultrasound guidance.", "metaData": {"source": "Initial clinical experience with real-time transrectal ultrasonography-magnetic resonance imaging fusion-guided prostate biopsy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18070196/"}}
