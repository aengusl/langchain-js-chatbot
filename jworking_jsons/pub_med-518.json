{"pageContent": "Four patients with biochemical prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure with suspected local recurrence at the vesico-urethral anastomotic site after radical prostatectomy were treated using a high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) device (Sonablate 500) under caudal or spinal anesthesia. The pretreatment PSA levels ranged from 0.318 to 0.898 ng/mL and their Gleason scores ranged between 5 and 7. HIFU treatment was carried out six times in four patients. The median time of operation and follow-up period were 30 min (range, 15-37) and 13 months (range, 7-18), respectively. In all patients, the median PSA levels decreased from 0.555 ng/mL (range, 0.318-0.898) to 0.137 ng/mL (range, 0.102-0.290). The median PSA nadir after each HIFU was 0.054 ng/mL (range, 0.008-0.097). No major complications were noted. HIFU may be useful for the therapy of vesicourethral anastomostic lesion in patients with PSA failure after prostatectomy.", "metaData": {"source": "Transrectal ultrasound-guided 10-core biopsy of the prostate for Japanese patients\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16813071/"}}
