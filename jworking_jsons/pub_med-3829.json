{"pageContent": "The effects of stage and therapy of prostate cancer on the immune response were evaluated in 193 patients with an histologic diagnosis of prostatic malignancy. There was little or no effect, as measured by these generally non-specific tests, on the immune response. The host-tumor immune interaction is difficult to evaluate in prostate cancer. The complexities of measuring prostate tumor immunity are discussed and the literature is reviewed.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer: the diagnostic dilemma and the place of imaging in detection and staging\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9542019/"}}
