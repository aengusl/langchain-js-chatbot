{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is the leading malignancy in men in the United States and causes more than 60,000 deaths annually. Treatment of prostate cancer, whether it be with surgery, radiation therapy, cryotherapy, or medical treatment, is associated with significant life-altering morbidity. Incontinence and erectile dysfunction (ED) too often are sequelae of these treatment alternatives. ED can be a significant complication and can alter the life of the patient with prostate cancer and his partner. Newer modifications of the radical prostatectomy with nerve-sparing techniques are the cornerstone of erection preservation. Time following radical prostatectomy has been shown to increase erectile function such that more patients have functional erections at 3 years than 1 year after surgery. With the advent of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, many men can have improved functional erections and return to active coitus. Prevention of ED also is an important management technique. Evidence is gathering that prophylaxis with regular vasoactive injection or daily PDE-5 agents may be an integral part of preservation of corpus cavernosum smooth muscle function. Combination medical therapy and surgical penile prosthesis implantation also are options for patients who do not respond to oral PDE-5 inhibitors.", "metaData": {"source": "Mixed Study Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Sexuality and Sexual Rehabilitation in LGBTQI+ Adults Living With Chronic Disease\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35973583/"}}
