{"pageContent": "Objectives: To evaluate the feasibility and safety of focal therapy for low-intermediate risk prostate cancer (PCa) with magnetic resonance-guided high frequency focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) METHODS: This IRB-approved phase 1 prospective study enrolled eight patients with prostate specific antigen (PSA) \u2264 10 ng/ml, \u2264 cT2a and Gleason score \u2264 7 (4 + 3) disease following informed consent. Under MRI guidance, focused high frequency ultrasound energy was delivered to ablate the target tissue. Treatment-related adverse events were recorded. Oncologic outcomes were evaluated with multiparametric MRI, PSA and TRUS biopsy at 6 months following treatment.", "metaData": {"source": "PSA testing and DRE, TRUS scanning with sector biopsy, improved histology, curative treatments, and active surveillance for prostate cancer: a success story for men's health\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19098969/"}}
