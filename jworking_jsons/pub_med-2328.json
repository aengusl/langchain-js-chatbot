{"pageContent": "What is this summary about?: This is a summary of a research article originally published in European Journal of Cancer. The PROSPER study involved men who had a type of advanced prostate cancer called nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). In men with nmCRPC, their cancer has progressed on traditional hormone therapy but scans show that it has not spread to other parts of the body. The main results of the PROSPER study showed that patients treated with enzalutamide lived longer than patients treated with placebo. For this analysis, researchers looked at whether this was different depending on patients' traits.", "metaData": {"source": "Screening for prostate cancer: estimating the magnitude of overdetection\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9861205/"}}
