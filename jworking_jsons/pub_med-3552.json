{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is one of the most significant cancers of men all over the world. The microRNAs (miRNAs) possess crucial functions in pathogenesis of the disease and its gain of androgen independency. The miRNAs are small, approximately 18-24 nucleotides, non-coding, endogenously synthesized RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. They are found in viruses, plants, and animal cells. The miRNAs have critical functions in gene expression and their dysregulation may cause tumor formation and progression of several diseases. Here, we have reviewed the most current literature to elucidate the function of miRNAs in human prostate cancer. We believe that this will help investigators not only working in prostate cancer, but also studying the miRNAs in other diseases to delineate the functions of miRNAs implicated in human prostate cancer development and progression.", "metaData": {"source": "Models predicting survival to guide treatment decision-making in newly diagnosed primary non-metastatic prostate cancer: a systematic review\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31230029/"}}
