{"pageContent": "Men diagnosed with low- to intermediate-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer (PCa) often face a daunting and difficult decision with respect to treatment: active surveillance (AS) or radical therapy. This decision is further confounded by the fact that many of these men diagnosed, by an elevated PSA, will have indolent disease and never require intervention. Radical treatments, including radical prostatectomy and whole-gland radiation, offer greater certainty for cancer control, but at the risk of significant urinary and/or sexual morbidity. Conversely, AS preserves genitourinary function and quality of life in exchange for burdensome surveillance and the psychological impact of living with cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Phosphodiesterase Type 5 Inhibitor Use and Disease Recurrence After Prostate Cancer Treatment\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26743040/"}}
