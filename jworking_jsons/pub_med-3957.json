{"pageContent": "Despite the revolutionary progress in cancer treatment using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), remarkable responses in prostate cancer treatment have not yet been achieved. The disappointing previous results of ICIs have required further studies towards combined treatment targeting other pathways and restricted the eligibility criteria for patients with high mutation burdens, especially those with mismatch repair deficiency. Cancer immunotherapies activate adaptive immune systems, rather than directly attack tumor cells with their own cytotoxicity. Therefore, refractoriness to ICIs can not only be derived from the intractable nature of tumor cells per se , but also from their hostile milieu. Here, we reviewed the prostate cancer immunotherapies exploring clinical trials to date, along with the molecular characteristics of prostate cancer and its microenvironment.", "metaData": {"source": "Contemporary approaches to prostate cancer management\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26467501/"}}
