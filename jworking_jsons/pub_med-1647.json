{"pageContent": "Improved selection criteria have led to an increasing number of nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomies (RRP) in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. The results based on patient questionnaires regarding postoperative erectile function are described. Between January 1992 and March 1999, 366 patients (mean age: 62.5 years) underwent uni- or bilateral nerve-sparing RRP at our institution. For evaluation of postoperative patient-reported rates of sexual and erectile function, a questionnaire was used after a follow-up of at least 12 months. Data of five operation periods were analyzed. The results of the unilateral procedure for the five operation periods revealed consistent rates of 13-29% for erections sufficient for intercourse. Bilateral nerve-sparing procedures were almost exclusively performed in periods 3 to 5; only four patients from period 2 underwent the bilateral procedure. The rates of intercourse-sufficient erections were 25% (period 2), 61% (period 3), 50% (period 4), and 52% (period 5), respectively. The results of the unilateral procedure were disappointing. However, the bilateral nerve-sparing method achieved much better results inasmuch as about 50% of the patients reported recovery of erections sufficient for sexual intercourse.", "metaData": {"source": "Erectile dysfunction following retropubic prostatectomy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23448953/"}}
