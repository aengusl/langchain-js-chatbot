{"pageContent": "With prostate cancer being diagnosed and treated in more than 300,000 men each year, the pool of long-term survivors is dramatically increasing. Because these patients are usually elderly, they are often receiving follow-up care for unrelated problems in a primary care setting. This offers the physician an excellent opportunity to assist in management of any long-term complications of therapy and in monitoring for cancer recurrence. In addition to performing follow-up evaluations, the physician can provide counseling about a number of testing and treatment issues, including the variability of prostate-specific antigen levels, the appropriateness of a watchful waiting approach to some cancers, and the management of treatment-induced incontinence and impotence, which often have a deleterious effect on quality of life but may be amenable to therapy and psychosocial support.", "metaData": {"source": "Prospective evaluation of a specific technique of sexual function preservation in external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28749171/"}}
