{"pageContent": "Background: Although androgen receptor-targeted agents prolong the lives of patients with metastatic prostate cancer, patients develop therapy resistance and most ultimately succumb to the disease. The PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway has been associated with the development of resistance, raising the possibility that pathway inhibitors may produce a clinical benefit. This open-label phase Ib study examined the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary clinical activity of adding capivasertib - a potent, selective inhibitor of AKT1/2/3 - to approved abiraterone acetate therapy.", "metaData": {"source": "[Mass screening for prostate cancer in Japan]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8965383/"}}
