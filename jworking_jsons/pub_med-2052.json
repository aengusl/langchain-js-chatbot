{"pageContent": "Background: Japanese-American (J-A) men who have immigrated to the U.S.A. and acquired the Western lifestyle usually have more invasive prostate cancer (PCa) than native Japanese (NJ) living in Japan. The specific reasons for these differences remain unknown. The objective of this study was to examine immunostainings of cathepsin B (CB) and its endogenous inhibitor stefin A (SA) in tissue microarray (TMA) and radical prostatectomy (RP) tissue sections in the hope of obtaining insights into the invasiveness of PCa in Japanese patients.", "metaData": {"source": "Current clinical presentation and treatment of localized prostate cancer in the United States\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24931803/"}}
