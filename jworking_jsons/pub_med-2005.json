{"pageContent": "Introduction: Prostate cancer (PCa) in many patients remains indolent for the rest of their lives, but in some patients, it progresses to lethal metastatic disease. Gleason score is the current clinical method for PCa prognosis. It cannot reliably identify aggressive PCa, when GS is \u2264 7. It is shown that oxidative stress plays a key role in PCa progression. We have shown that in cultured human PCa cells, an activation of spermidine/spermine N(1) -acetyl transferase (SSAT; EC 2.3.1.57) enzyme initiates a polyamine oxidation pathway and generates copious amounts of reactive oxygen species in polyamine-rich PCa cells.", "metaData": {"source": "Laparoscopic versus Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy for the Treatment of Localised Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26201500/"}}
