{"pageContent": "Incontinence is a known complication of radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Recently, climacturia, or orgasmic incontinence, has been reported after this procedure. Patients have occasionally reported some loss of urine during sexual foreplay, even when general daytime incontinence was not present. A review of questions on this subject was conducted in 45 men to better appreciate how often this occurred. Nine of twenty-four men (38%) with no daytime incontinence stated that they had some incontinence with sexual foreplay. These men involved have related that this causes embarrassment and frustration, with the effect of avoidance of sexual activity. This in turn causes relationship problems. The use of a rubber ring at the base of the penis during foreplay can help relieve this difficulty.", "metaData": {"source": "Longitudinal assessment of changes in sexual function and bother in patients treated with external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy, with and without neoadjuvant androgen ablation: data from CaPSURE\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15519776/"}}
