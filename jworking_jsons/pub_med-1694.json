{"pageContent": "Background: Prebiopsy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate improves detection of significant tumors, while decreasing detection of less-aggressive tumors. Therefore, its use has been increasing over time. In this study, the use of prebiopsy MRI among Medicare beneficiaries with prostate cancer was examined. It was hypothesized that patients of color and those in isolated areas would be less likely to undergo this approach for cancer detection.", "metaData": {"source": "Evolution of robotic radical prostatectomy: assessment after 2766 procedures\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17893904/"}}
