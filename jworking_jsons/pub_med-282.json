{"pageContent": "Purpose: The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) recently allowed the marketing of 2 high intensity focused ultrasound devices for prostate tissue ablation indications after previous rejections for a prostate cancer indication due to insufficient data on clinical effectiveness or direct patient benefit. We reviewed the safety and effectiveness of high intensity focused ultrasound and knowledge regarding patient preferences, such as tolerance for adverse events associated with high intensity focused ultrasound ablation of tissue, in men with prostate cancer. This may inform decision making for device developers and the FDA.", "metaData": {"source": "Urethral strictures and the cancer survivor\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24809412/"}}
