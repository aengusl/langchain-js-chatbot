{"pageContent": "Although most patients with prostate cancer respond to initial androgen-deprivation therapy, progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is almost inevitable. In 2004, the docetaxel/prednisone regimen was approved for the management of patients with metastatic CRPC, becoming the standard first-line therapy. Recent advances have also led to an unprecedented number of approved new drugs; thus, providing several treatment options for patients with metastatic CRPC. Five new drugs have received US Food and Drug Administration-approval between 2010 and 2012: sipuleucel-T, an immunotherapeutic agent; cabazitaxel, a novel microtubule inhibitor; abiraterone acetate, a new androgen biosynthesis inhibitor; enzalutamide, a novel androgen receptor inhibitor; and denosumab, a bone-targeting agent. Such drugs are either already marketed or about to be marketed in the Middle East. Data supporting the approval of each of these agents are described in this review, as are recent approaches to the treatment of metastatic CRPC.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer stem cell therapy: hype or hope?\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18427568/"}}
