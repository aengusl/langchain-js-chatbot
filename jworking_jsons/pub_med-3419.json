{"pageContent": "The first edition of Clinical Practice Guidelines for Prostate Cancer was created mainly by the Japanese Urological Association as a part of the 2003-2004 Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) Scientific Research Fund-supported Thorough Researches for the Evaluation of Medical Technologies. The guidelines were aimed to be used by general urologists committed to the treatment of all stages of prostate cancer patients. The guidelines supervised by the Japanese Urological Association were published in May 2006. The present edition of the guidelines are accepted as a good summary of prostate cancer treatment. However, since the present edition is over 3 years old, a revision of the guidelines is planned to update the contents and findings. In this article, I will summarize the changes and updates in each field.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate-specific antigen doubling time as a prognostic marker in prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16474622/"}}
