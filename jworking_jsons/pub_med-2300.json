{"pageContent": "In all, 30% to 90% of prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) recover their erectile capacity. No effective post RP erectile rehabilitation program exists to date. The aim of this exploratory qualitative study is to explore the needs of these patients and to develop a patient education program (PEP) which meets these needs. Interviews were carried out by a socio-anthropologist with prostate cancer patients treated by RP within the 6 previous months. The needs and expectations identified led to the choice of a logical model of change for the construction of the PEP. Nineteen patients were included in the study; 17 of them were living with a partner. Two categories of patients appeared during the interviews: informed patients resigned to lose their sexuality and patients misinformed about the consequences of the surgery. The tailored program was built on the Health Belief Model and provides six individual sessions, including one with the partner, to meet the needs identified. This study designed the first program to target comprehensively the overall sexuality of the patient and his partner, and not only erection issues. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this program, a controlled, multicentric clinical trial is currently ongoing.", "metaData": {"source": "Second-line treatment of metastatic prostatic carcinoma\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9144891/"}}
