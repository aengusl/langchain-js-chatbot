{"pageContent": "Based on a review of recently published articles, we evaluated the current status of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) as a primary treatment option for localized prostate cancer and as a salvage therapy when radiation has failed. With mid- and long-term progression-free survival rates around 70%, negative postoperative prostate biopsies almost 90%, and an excellent morbidity profile, primary HIFU appears to be a valid alternative to active surveillance protocols in low-risk patients and standard therapies in patients with life expectancies of 10 or fewer years. Moreover, HIFU has a considerable potential for local-only recurrence after radiation failure. HIFU is a recent technology, and many improvements will undoubtedly expand its future indications and use for the management of prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Conventional radical versus focal treatment for localised prostate cancer: a propensity score weighted comparison of 6-year tumour control\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33934114/"}}
