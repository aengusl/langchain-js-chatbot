Radical cystectomy has a considerable incidence of functional morbidity, and concerns regarding morbidity can delay initiation of cystectomy by the patient or physician, thereby affecting long-term prognosis. Some investigators have advocated prostate-sparing cystectomy to improve postoperative continence and potency rates, and enhance patient acceptance of timely cystectomy.
