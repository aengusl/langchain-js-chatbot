{"pageContent": "BACKGROUND Early-onset prostate cancer patients (aged \u226455 years) from Western countries have been well characterized in previous studies. However, the clinicopathological and prognostic characteristics of early-onset Chinese prostate cancer patients have not yet been assessed. This study aimed to examine the clinicopathological and prognostic factors of prostate cancer patients aged \u226455 years in a single Chinese center. MATERIAL AND METHODS One hundred six prostate cancer patients aged \u226455 years with complete clinicopathological data who were treated at our hospital between January 2000 and June 2014 were selected for this study. Survival rate was investigated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and prognostic factors were examined by univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS The median time from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 3.5 months (range, 2-55 months). The median time after endocrine therapy to development of androgen-independent prostate cancer was 10.5 months. A total of 54 patients died (50.9%), of whom 96.2% died from prostate cancer. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 88.7%, 66.2%, and 36.0%, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that T staging, visceral metastasis, pathological pattern, and Gleason sum were independent prognostic factors in these patients. CONCLUSIONS Prostate cancer patients aged \u226455 years are often omitted or misdiagnosed in China. Furthermore, the pathology patterns in this age group were mostly complicated with a high degree of malignancy. Late staging, visceral metastasis, pathological pattern, and high Gleason score were independent prognostic factors in these patients. Comprehensive therapy combined with local therapy is an effective treatment strategy.", "metaData": {"source": "Outcome analysis of prostate cancer patients with pre-treatment PSA greater than 50 ng/ml\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18570713/"}}
