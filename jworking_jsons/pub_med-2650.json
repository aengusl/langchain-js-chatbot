{"pageContent": "Despite notable screening, diagnostic, and therapeutic advances, disparities in prostate cancer incidence and outcomes remain prevalent. Although commonly discussed in the context of men of African descent, disparities also exist based on socioeconomic level, education level, and geographic location. The factors in these disparities span systemic access issues affecting availability of care, provider awareness, and personal patient views and mistrust. In this review, we will discuss common themes that patients have noted as impediments to care. We will review how equitable access to care has helped improve outcomes among many different groups of patients, including those with local disease and those with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Even with more advanced presentation, challenges with recommended screening, and lower rates of genomic testing and trial inclusion, Black populations have benefited greatly from various modalities of therapy, achieving comparable and at times superior outcomes with certain types of immunotherapy, chemotherapy, androgen receptor-based inhibitors, and radiopharmaceuticals in advanced disease. We will also briefly discuss access to genomic testing and differences in patterns of gene expression among Black patients and other groups that are traditionally underrepresented in trials and genomic cohort studies. We propose several strategies on behalf of providers and institutions to help promote more equitable care access environments and continued decreases in prostate cancer disparities across many subgroups.", "metaData": {"source": "Factors influencing treatment decisions in patients with low risk prostate cancer referred to a brachytherapy clinic\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19046495/"}}
