{"pageContent": "Advanced prostate cancer includes a wide spectrum of disease ranging from hormone na\u00efve or hormone sensitive to castration resistant, both containing populations of men who have demonstrable metastatic and non-metastatic states. The mainstay of treatment for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). However, recent level 1 evidence demonstrates that the addition of chemotherapy or abiraterone acetate to ADT results in significant survival advantage as compared with ADT alone. Furthermore, in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (M0 CRPC), two second-generation anti-androgens, apalutamide and enzalutamide, when used in combination with ADT, have demonstrated a significant benefit in metastasis-free survival. Here, we review the most recent studies leading to these significant changes in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Results of surgery for high-risk prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23702565/"}}
