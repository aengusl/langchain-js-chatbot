{"pageContent": "A lack of appropriate diagnostic tools for prostate cancer has led to overdiagnosis and over treatment. In a recent publication in the New England Journal of Medicine, Hamdy et al showed no difference in the outcomes of patients that had undergone either radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, or active monitoring. In an effort to enhance clinical stratification, the development of improved, more accurate diagnostic tools is actively being pursued. Herein, we explore recent advances in prostate cancer screening, including biomarker assays, genetic testing, and specialized fields, such as mathematical oncology. These newly developed, highly sensitive diagnostic assays may potentially aid clinicians in selecting appropriate therapies for patients in the very near future.", "metaData": {"source": "Disparities in prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates: Solvable or not?\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31702061/"}}
