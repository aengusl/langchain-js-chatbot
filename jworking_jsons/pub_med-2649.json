{"pageContent": "Purpose: Men with germline mutations in DNA repair genes have a higher risk of prostate cancer. Active surveillance is the preferred treatment modality for low risk prostate cancer. However, many fear offering this alternative to men with germline mutations. We describe the short-term oncologic outcomes of active surveillance in a population of men with a high genetic predisposition for prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "The role of chemotherapy in prostate cancer.
