{"pageContent": "Background: Despite being formally included in the assessment of patients presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) is not routinely offered to these patients. This tactic however might not be optimum since data exist on the superiority of TRUS over transabdominal ultrasound in accurately predicting prostate volumes. We aimed to evaluate TRUS as a standard tool in the evaluation of patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) with a special focus on the potential impact it might have on the decision of open versus transurethral surgery.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer relapse after therapy with curative intention: a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15933426/"}}
