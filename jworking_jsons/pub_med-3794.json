{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer incidences in most Asian populations have rapidly increased, and prostate cancer ranks as the highest incidence of male cancer in Japan since 2015. Androgen depriva- tion therapy (ADT) remains the main first-line treatment for patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa). However, treatment benefits last for 3-5 years when disease transforms into metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Currently, management paradigms for mPCa are dramatically changing. Two multicenter, randomized trials have redefined first-line treatment, with the demonstration of improved overall survival with the addition of docetaxel chemotherapy to ADT. Several data have re- ported the impact on survival of radiotherapy of the prostate even in patients diagnosed with mPCa. The objective of this review is to summarize an overview of current multidisciplinary approaches for mPCa and mCRPC.", "metaData": {"source": "The treatment of prostate cancer: an overview of current options\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11879332/"}}
