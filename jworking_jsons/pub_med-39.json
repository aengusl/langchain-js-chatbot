Surgery, radiotherapy and hormonal manipulation represent its typical treatment. High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is an alternative choice in localized prostate cancer. To date, an index for prediction of recurrence in patients treated with HIFU is not availabe. Our study proposes a novel index for the predition of recurrence able to determine if a candidate is fit for this tratment.", "metaData": {"source": "[Indications, techniques and outcomes of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for the treatment of localized prostate cancer]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18265750/"}}
