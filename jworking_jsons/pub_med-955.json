{"pageContent": "Purpose: To our knowledge the relationship between the underlying etiology of erectile dysfunction and its impact on health related quality of life has not been studied. Such a study is important for men with prostate cancer, as the potential negative quality of life impact of erectile dysfunction may affect clinical decision making in newly diagnosed disease. We compare health related quality of life in impotent men with prostate cancer to that of impotent men without prostate cancer using the Exploratory and Comprehensive Evaluation of Erectile Dysfunction (ExCEED, TAP Pharmaceutical Products, Inc., Lake Forest, Illinois) data base, which is a multicenter, observational disease registry of men with erectile dysfunction.", "metaData": {"source": "Life after prostate cancer treatment: a mixed methods study of the experiences of men with sexual dysfunction and their partners\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28619019/"}}
