{"pageContent": "Despite extensive clinical research of different chemotherapy agents for more than three decades, the role of chemotherapy in prostate cancer was only established in 2004, after demonstrating a survival benefit with docetaxel in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. 6 years later, second-line chemotherapy using cabazitaxel, after disease progression on docetaxel, demonstrated an additional survival improvement. Recently, docetaxel given alongside standard hormonal therapy in newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer was found to lead to significantly improved patient outcomes. This article aims to cover the role of chemotherapy in prostate cancer and the latest developments.", "metaData": {"source": "Theragnostic radionuclides: a clinical perspective\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34881851/"}}
