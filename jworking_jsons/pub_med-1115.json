{"pageContent": "Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been an essential treatment option for treating prostate cancer (PCa). The role for hormonal treatment initially was restricted to men with metastatic and inoperable, locally advanced disease. Now it has been extended to neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy for surgery and radiotherapy, for biochemical relapse after surgery or radiation, and even as primary therapy for non-metastatic disease. Fifty percent of PCa patients treated will receive ADT at some point. There is growing concern about the adverse effects and costs associated with more widespread ADT use. The adverse effects on quality of life (QoL), including physical, social and psychological well-being when men are androgen-deprived, may be considerable. This review examines the QoL issues in the following areas: body feminisation, sexual changes, relationship changes, cognitive and affective symptoms, fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression and physical effects. Further suggestions for therapeutic approaches to reduce these alterations are suggested.", "metaData": {"source": "[Modification of sexual desire and orgasm after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21193145/"}}
