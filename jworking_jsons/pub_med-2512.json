{"pageContent": "Purpose: Our previously published data showed rapidly increasing rates of prostate cancer screening in men aged 50-74, which rose from 36% in 2005 to 48% in 2008. Based on men's reported intentions at that time, this was expected to rise to 70% in 2011. Here we report the actual rate of prostate cancer screening.", "metaData": {"source": "The Men's Eating and Living (MEAL) study: a Cancer and Leukemia Group B pilot trial of dietary intervention for the treatment of prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18280560/"}}
