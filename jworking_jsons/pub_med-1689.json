{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second-leading cause of death from cancer in U.S. men. For older men with early-stage prostate cancer, watchful waiting (also referred to as surveillance, expectant management, deferred/delayed therapy, or active monitoring) is a reasonable approach to aggressive therapy. The purpose of this article is to critically review published studies on the watchful waiting management option for prostate cancer within the past 5 years. The review of documented reports on watchful waiting reveals that there are both negative and positive indications toward watchful waiting. Further research is needed to change the perception of watchful waiting as a \"do nothing\" approach to the management of prostate cancer or a \"death sentence\" and to develop interventions that assist men to manage the uncertainty associated with living with prostate cancer to improve health and advance quality of life.", "metaData": {"source": "Biochemical failure-rate and preservation of erectile function after prostate seed brachytherapy in early-onset prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35150220/"}}
