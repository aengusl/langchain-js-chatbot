{"pageContent": "Purpose: This study aimed to prospectively analyze the role of magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) and dynamic-contrast enhancement magnetic resonance (DCEMR) in the detection of prostate tumor foci in patients with persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen levels (in the range of >or=4 ng/mL to <10 ng/mL) and prior negative random trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate specific antigen velocity per prostate volume: a novel tool for prostate biopsy prediction\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21791361/"}}
