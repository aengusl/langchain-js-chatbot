{"pageContent": "Purpose: Patients with high grade (Gleason score 8 to 10) prostate cancer on biopsy are at high risk for cancer recurrence after local treatment, such as radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy. We examined long-term outcomes in patients with high grade prostate cancer on biopsy who were treated with radical prostatectomy alone. We also investigated the impact on outcomes of changes in the radical prostatectomy Gleason score.", "metaData": {"source": "Comparison of outcomes of radiotherapy-treated localized prostate cancer patients within a clinical trial setting versus real-life setting\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30887820/"}}
