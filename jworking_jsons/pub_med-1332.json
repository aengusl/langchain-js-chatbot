{"pageContent": "Older adult patients with prostate cancer experience symptoms such as uncontrolled sexual and urinary dysfunction after radical prostatectomy, which lowers self-esteem. Lack of access to information about the illness increases uncertainty, requiring interventions from healthcare providers. This study aimed to identify factors affecting the self-esteem of older adult patients who underwent prostate cancer surgery and provided data for establishing nursing strategies to promote healthy lifespans. This cross-sectional study examined participants over 65 years old who underwent radical prostatectomy at two university hospitals in 2017. The results indicated that the most influential factor for self-esteem was inconsistency-related uncertainty, followed by postoperative symptom experience and healthcare provider support. These variables explained 43% of the variance in self-esteem. To improve self-esteem among older adult patients who undergo radical prostatectomy, integrated programs that include sexual-related symptom management, such as erectile dysfunction and incontinence, and healthcare provider support should be developed to reduce inconsistency-related uncertainty.", "metaData": {"source": "Neobladder with prostatic capsule and seminal-sparing cystectomy for bladder cancer: a step in the wrong direction\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15862615/"}}
