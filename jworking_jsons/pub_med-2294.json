{"pageContent": "Background: Our recently reported finding of rapid bi-exponential elimination of free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after radical retropubic prostatectomy in patients with moderately elevated PSA levels, which contrasted a very slow, linear elimination of PSA complexed to alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), prompted us to study whether these elimination rates were applicable for patients selected for castration treatment with very high pretreatment concentrations of PSA in serum. In addition, serum concentrations of hK2, the activator of proPSA, were measured.", "metaData": {"source": "The use of treatments for erectile dysfunction among survivors of prostate carcinoma\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12436448/"}}
