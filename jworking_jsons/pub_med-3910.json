{"pageContent": "Pelvic lymph node involvement in prostate cancer is a significant poor prognostic factor with very little evidence on the optimal management options for these patients. It is estimated that lymph node-positive patients make up 12% of newly diagnosed prostate cancer and this figure is expected to rise with the advancement and increasing use of novel imaging. The controversy around this subgroup of patients is whether this is an intermediary stage before disseminated disease and hence amenable to curative treatment options. Systemic therapies have been the mainstay of treatment for these patients for decades, but in recent years, studies have emerged supporting the addition of local therapy. This review will focus on the current multimodal management approach for clinical and pathological lymph node-positive prostate cancer with a focus on radiotherapy options and aims to provide the rationale for a curative approach with a combination of local and systemic therapy.", "metaData": {"source": "Target populations and strategies for chemoprevention trials of prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7823591/"}}
