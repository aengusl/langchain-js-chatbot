{"pageContent": "We review the importance of quality of life (QOL) data from patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) among men treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) or localized prostate cancer treated with adjuvant therapy. This information is important for patients as they make treatment choices and for regulatory agencies approving drug therapies. Studies of treatments for mCSPC suggest that the improvements in survival associated with more intensive systemic treatment are accompanied by improvements in QOL. ADT prolongs survival among men with intermediate- or high-risk localized disease in combination with radiation, but the optimal duration is still being defined. For men with biochemical recurrence, starting ADT earlier rather than later had minimal adverse effects on QOL but may not prolong survival. We conclude that rigorous assessment of QOL with validated PROMs must be a priority for clinical trials of novel and more intensive approaches to treatment with ADT. PATIENT SUMMARY: Data on quality of life that are collected using patient-reported outcome measures are important for patients with prostate cancer as they make treatment choices and for regulatory agencies approving drug therapies.", "metaData": {"source": "Unamplified and Real-Time Label-Free miRNA-21 Detection Using Solution-Gated Graphene Transistors in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36480308/"}}
