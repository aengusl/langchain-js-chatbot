{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is a life-threatening and highly heterogeneous malignancy. In the past decade, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have been suggested to play a critical role in the occurrence and progression of prostate cancer. In particular, as the \"seed\" of the cancer metastasis cascade, CTCs determine numerous biological behaviors, such as tumor invasion into adjacent tissues and migration to distant organs. Many studies have shown that CTCs are necessary in the processes of tumor progression, including tumorigenesis, invasion, metastasis, and colonization. Furthermore, CTCs express various biomarkers relevant to prostate cancer and thus can be applied clinically in noninvasive tests. Moreover, CTCs can serve as potential prognostic targets in prostate cancer due to their roles in regulating many processes associated with cancer metastasis. In this review, we discuss the isolation and detection of CTCs as predictive markers of prostate cancer, and we discuss their clinical application in the diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer and in monitoring the response to treatment and the prediction of metastasis.", "metaData": {"source": "NCCN Asia Consensus Statement prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30184146/"}}
