{"pageContent": "Aims: Most men with low-risk localised prostate cancer prefer treatments with high control rates and minimal disruption to their lives. Hypofractionating external radiation treatments can theoretically maintain high bioequivalent tumour doses, decrease treatment visits and decrease acute and late toxicities. The aim of this study was to assess the toxicity and feasibility of a hypofractionated accelerated regimen for these patients.", "metaData": {"source": "The association between socioeconomic status, health insurance coverage, and quality of life in men with prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11297885/"}}
