{"pageContent": "Diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) recurrence after therapy with curative intent currently depends primarily on biochemical serum analyses. When recurrence is suspected, further treatment decisions rely heavily on the confirmation of disease presence and determination of its extent. This is complicated by the fact that benign conditions can mimic biochemical recurrence, and serum studies do not reliably discriminate between local and distant recurrence. This review discusses the contemporary imaging paradigm for the evaluation of local PCa recurrence. The multidisciplinary implications for urologists, radiation oncologists and radiologists are examined. Emerging techniques and future directions of PCa imaging research are discussed.", "metaData": {"source": "Molecular profiling in prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12085960/"}}
