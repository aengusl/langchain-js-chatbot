{"pageContent": "Liver metastasis from prostate cancer is uncommon and remains poorly understood. We computer searched the clinical records of all our patients registered into a database to identify patients that presented or developed liver metastases. A total of 27 prostate cancer patients with ultrasound or CT/MR imaging evidence of liver metastases were included in our analysis. The liver metastasis rate from metastatic prostate cancer was 4.29%. Eight (29.63%) patients had previously untreated, hormone-naive prostate cancer (synchronous liver metastases at diagnosis of prostate cancer), whereas 19 (70.37%) patients had already been diagnosed as having hormone-refractory prostate cancer. In the hormone-naive group, the median overall survival after liver metastases diagnosis was 38 months and half of the patients were still alive at the latest follow-up, whereas only 6 months in the hormone-refractory group (p = 0.003). High concentration of serum neuron-specific enolase and previous chemotherapy were associated with a significantly poor overall survival after liver metastases in the hormone-refractory group using Kaplan\u2013Meier curves and logrank tests for univariate analysis.", "metaData": {"source": "Treatment of prostate cancer in obese patients\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17024870/"}}
