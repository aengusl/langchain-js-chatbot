{"pageContent": "Consideration of the number of prostate biopsy samples found to be positive for cancer may add clinically useful information to T stage, Gleason score, and prostate-specific antigen level in predicting outcome after radical prostatectomy. Higher radiation doses and neoadjuvant hormone therapy has been applied successfully to patients with higher risk disease. Brachytherapy has emerged as a modality for localized prostate cancer with outcomes and toxicity being further defined. Efforts to measure and improve quality of life are an important part of prostate cancer research. Standard management of metastatic disease remains androgen ablation, with long-term side effects being recognized. Newer hormonal and chemotherapeutic agents are being explored for patients with metastatic disease.", "metaData": {"source": "Patient-reported outcome measures after treatment for prostate cancer: Results from the Danish Prostate Cancer Registry (DAPROCAdata)\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31760356/"}}
