{"pageContent": "Despite a follow-up too short to allow a relevant assessment of the HIFU efficacy in terms of definitive cure of localized prostate cancer, the last published results from the European multicentric study and from Gelet may consider the HIFU treatment as a valuable alternative option for well differentiated tumors, with an initial PSA<15 ng/ml, in men with a life expectancy more than 5 years. The main advantages of the HIFU treatment are its low morbidity, the option for repeated HIFU treatment, the possible treatment of patients who previously underwent prostate resection, the early local control with biopsies and, if needed, radiotherapy may be performed after HIFU, without increased morbidity.", "metaData": {"source": "5-Year Outcomes Following Focal Laser Ablation of Prostate Cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34090887/"}}
