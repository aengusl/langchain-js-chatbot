{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is one of the major malignant diseases in Western countries. In Japan, the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer is not so high, but is continuously increasing. The recent drastic increase in incidence has been attributed to the growth of the elderly population, a westernized diet in daily life, widespread environmental contamination, and improved screening techniques such as the serum PSA test. The epidemiology of prostate cancer hints that its etiology is both environmental and genetic. Androgenic stimulation over time, perhaps due to a high fat diet, has been suggested as a cause of prostate cancer. Dietary factors such as phytoestrogens, vitamins and trace elements are suggested to have a protective effect against prostate cancer, and encourage us to search for means of prevention. Some have suggested that certain polymorphisms increase the risk of prostate cancer, whereas others are searching for genetic mutations that may also increase prostate cancer risk. The cause of prostate cancer is likely to be a combination of environmental and genetic factors.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate MRI in Stereotactic Body Radiation Treatment Planning and Delivery for Localized Prostate Cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35714039/"}}
