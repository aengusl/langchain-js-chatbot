{"pageContent": "Background: Voiding and sexual function after treatment are major determinants of quality of life in prostate carcinoma patients. Erectile dysfunction, incontinence, and urinary symptoms, both obstructive and irritative, have a significant negative impact on patient quality of life. This prospective study was undertaken to evaluate voiding, sexual function, and their impact on patients with localized prostate carcinoma who were treated with radical retropubic prostatectomy (RP) and to compare these patients with patients who were undergoing hormonobrachytherapy with external bean radiotherapy (HBTC) and patients who were undergoing hormonobrachytherapy without external beam radiotherapy (HBT).", "metaData": {"source": "Myths and fallacies in permanent prostate brachytherapy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14563434/"}}
