{"pageContent": "Several endocrinological and physical activities orchestrate men's sexual activities. To determine whether body composition calculated by computed tomography measurements is useful for estimating sexual function, we evaluated sexual function of localised prostate cancer patients using the Sexual Health Inventory for Men score, an original questionnaire, and computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The imaging was performed to determine body composition, particularly the psoas muscle. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors affecting sexual activity. The multivariate analysis showed that the volume of the psoas muscle was significantly correlated with sexual activity (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]) (2.507 [1.029-6.109], p = 0.043) and erectile dysfunction (0.261 [0.098-0.692], p = 0.006). We concluded that the psoas muscle is an important predictor of sexual activity and erectile function.", "metaData": {"source": "Older patients' willingness to trade off urologic adverse outcomes for a better chance at five-year survival in the clinical setting of prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7657938/"}}
