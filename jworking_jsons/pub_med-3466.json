{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is a public health concern as it currently represents the most frequent malignancy in men in Europe. Progression of this hormone-dependent cancer is driven by androgens. Thus, the most common treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer consists in an androgen ablation by castration therapy. However, the majority of patients relapses and develops a castration-resistant prostate cancer. This failure of androgen deprivation is related to the emergence of mutant and splice variants of the androgen receptor. Indeed, androgen receptor variants are ligand-independent, constitutively active and thus able to induce resistance to castration. This review focuses on AR variants signaling pathways and their role in resistance to castration and prostate cancer progression.", "metaData": {"source": "[The treatment options for localized prostate cancer]\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16450723/"}}
