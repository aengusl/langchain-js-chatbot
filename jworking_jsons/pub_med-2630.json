{"pageContent": "The combination of radiation treatment and long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been shown in multiple clinical trials to prolong overall survival in men with high-risk prostate cancer compared with either treatment alone. New radiation technologies enable the safe delivery of high radiation doses that improve cancer control compared with lower radiation doses. Based on the results of multiple randomized trials, clinical practice guidelines for high-risk prostate cancer recommend total radiation doses of at least 75.6 Gy, with long-term (2-3 years) ADT. Ongoing research into hypofractionated radiation treatment, whole-pelvic radiation, and combinations of radiation with novel hormonal agents could further improve cancer control and survival outcomes for patients with high-risk prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "The experiences of gay and bisexual men diagnosed with prostate cancer: results from an online focus group\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23730947/"}}
