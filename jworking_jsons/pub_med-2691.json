{"pageContent": "There have been significant advancements in the quality and precision of radiation therapy (RT) for prostate cancer over the past two decades. The development and implementation of intensity-modulated radiation therapy has allowed for RT dose-escalation without parallel increases in treatment morbidity. Moreover, integration of androgen deprivation therapy with definitive RT has led to improvements in outcomes for certain subgroups of prostate cancer patients. In this review, we highlight several ongoing and developing technical advances that hold promise for further optimizing RT care, including proton beam therapy, inter- and intra-fractional image-guided dose-delivery, methods for improved target volume definition, and development of techniques for safely performing hypofractionation and stereotactic body radiotherapy. We also discuss the importance of investigating the potential benefit of integrating novel systemic therapies with prostate RT to further improve outcomes for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Heterogeneity of tumor cells in the bone microenvironment: Mechanisms and therapeutic targets for bone metastasis of prostate or breast cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26656603/"}}
