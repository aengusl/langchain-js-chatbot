{"pageContent": "Despite recent advances, prostate cancer (PCa) remains a leading cause of cancer morbidity and mortality. Clinically, PCa screening methods display low sensitivity and specificity, leading to suboptimal patient care. Recent research suggests that PCa progression is regulated by a coordinated spectrum of epigenetic alterations that notably involves noncoding RNAs. These molecular aberrations drive PCa progression by inducing gene expression programs that promote metastatic dissemination. Epigenetic proteins and noncoding RNAs can be detected noninvasively in body fluids, allowing improved PCa screening and prognosis. In addition, epigenetic alterations can be targeted pharmacologically, providing unprecedented therapeutic opportunities. This work reviews the current literature linking epigenetic dysregulation and PCa progression and proposes a framework for integrating epigenetic strategies into the clinical management of PCa.", "metaData": {"source": "Effects of skeletal morbidities on longitudinal patient-reported outcomes and survival in patients with metastatic prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17262196/"}}
