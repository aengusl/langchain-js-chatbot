{"pageContent": "The aim of the study was to assess frequency of various complications of transrectal multifocal biopsy of the prostate (TMBP), to specify prophylactic measures against such complications. Primary TMBP under US guidance was made in 612 patients (mean age 65.8 years, mean level of PSA 12.6 ng/ml). TMBP complications include: hematuria (220 patients, 35.9%), hemospermia (166 patients, 27.1%), pain in the perineum and the rectum (189, 30.9%), acute prostatitis (21 patients, 3.4%), acute orchiepididymitis (7 patients, 1.1%), acute urine retention (9 patients, 1.5%), long-term rectal hemorrhage (13 patients, 2.1%), loss of consciousness during the biopsy (7 patients, 1.1%). The analysis of TMBP complications leads to the conclusion that adequate preparation of the patients and accurate conduction of the prostatic biopsy technique under US guidance make this invasive manipulation diagnostically effective and safe.", "metaData": {"source": "1.5-D high intensity focused ultrasound array for non-invasive prostate cancer surgery\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11885680/"}}
