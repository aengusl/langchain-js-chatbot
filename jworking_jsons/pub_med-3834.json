{"pageContent": "New gene expressed in prostate (NGEP) is a newly diagnosed prostate-specific gene that is expressed only in normal prostate and prostate cancer cells. Discovery of tissue-specific markers may promote the development of novel targets for immunotherapy of prostate cancer. In the present study, the staining pattern and clinical significance of NGEP were evaluated in a series of prostate tissues composed of 123 prostate cancer, 19 high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and 44 samples of benign prostate tissue included in tissue microarrays using immunohistochemistry. Our study demonstrated that NGEP localized mainly in the apical and lateral membranes and was also partially distributed in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells of normal prostate tissue. All of the examined prostate tissues expressed NGEP with a variety of intensities; the level of expression was significantly more in the benign prostate tissues compared to malignant prostate samples (P value <0.001). Among prostate adenocarcinoma samples, a significant and inverse correlation was observed between the intensity of NGEP expression and increased Gleason score (P = 0.007). Taken together, we found that NGEP protein is widely expressed in low-grade to high-grade prostate adenocarcinomas as well as benign prostate tissues, and the intensity of expression is inversely proportional to the level of malignancy. NGEP could be an attractive target for immune-based therapy of prostate cancer patients as an alternative to the conventional therapies particularly in indolent patients.", "metaData": {"source": "An update on prostate cancer research\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10841200/"}}
