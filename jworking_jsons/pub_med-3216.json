{"pageContent": "There is no standard treatment for locally advanced prostate cancer. Even the definition is still unclear. Locally advanced disease may refer to over-staged well-curable tumors as well as to advanced and probably incurable cancers. Similar uncertainties are present regarding the definition of 'old' in this context. Conservatively treated locally advanced prostate cancer is associated with poor survival outcome. With the increasing life expectancy, in the absence of curative treatment, even patients in their ninth decade of life may later suffer from symptoms of aggressive prostate cancer and are at a high risk of death from prostate cancer that might be prevented at least in part by early intervention. On the other hand, functional results after prostate cancer treatment are worse in elderly patients. In this article we discuss aspects of the management of locally advanced prostate cancer in the elderly with special focus on the recommendation of current clinical guidelines.", "metaData": {"source": "Radiation therapy or prostatectomy: an old conflict revisited in the PSA era.
