{"pageContent": "Purpose: Anatomical nerve sparing radical prostatectomy provides excellent cancer control, although the recovery of sexual function is variable. We recently described a technique to preserve the prostatic fascia (veil of Aphrodite) that appears to enhance the quality of nerve preservation during robotic prostatectomy. In January 2003 we initiated a prospective study comparing patients undergoing prostatic fascia preservation with those undergoing conventional nerve sparing robotic radical prostatectomy. We report results at 12 months of followup", "metaData": {"source": "Intraoperative nerve stimulation predicts postoperative potency\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11597546/"}}
