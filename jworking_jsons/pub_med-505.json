{"pageContent": "The purpose of this study is to report our method in detecting prostate cancer (PCa) using an 18-core transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) prostate biopsy (PB) schema, in combination with additional targeted cores from suspicious images in conventional (e-cMRI) and functional (e-fMRI) endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (e-MRI) of the prostate. From 2004 to 2008, 260 consecutive patients with a clinical suspicion of PCa underwent PB and were prospectively studied. e-cMRI and e-fMRI was performed in all patients before PB. The patients were divided into two groups (A and B) according to the results of their radiological findings (group A=suspicious findings, group B=non-suspicious findings). After the images were processed, an 18-core TRUS-guided PB was performed. When a patient exhibited a suspicious site on e-cMRI and e-fMRI images, three additional targeted PBs were obtained from that site. In group A, 17.5% of PCa was detected by the 18-core PB and 56.5% of PCa was detected by the targeted cores. The overall PCa detection rate (18+targeted cores) was 73.9%. The overall specificity was 73.9%. In group B, overall false-positive detection rate reached 19.2%, with the overall sensitivity being 80.8%. The method described above is not only practical but also a promising modality in PCa detection. As seen, PCa was optimally detected when combining the 18-core and targeted-core PB schema together. Non-suspicious images do not rule out the probability of PCa, thus justifying a PB in these patients as well.", "metaData": {"source": "Comparative Healthcare Research Outcomes of Novel Surgery in prostate cancer (IP4-CHRONOS): A prospective, multi-centre therapeutic phase II parallel Randomised Control Trial\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32302790/"}}
