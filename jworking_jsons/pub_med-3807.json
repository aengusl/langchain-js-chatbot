{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer (PC) is a common malignancy among elderly males and is noncurable once it becomes metastatic. In recent years, a number of antigen-delivery systems have emerged as viable and promising immunotherapeutic agents against PC. The approval of sipuleucel-T by the US FDA for the treatment of males with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic castrate resistant PC was a landmark in cancer immunotherapy, making this the first approved immunotherapeutic. A number of vaccines are under clinical investigation, each having its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Here, we discuss the basic technologies underlying these different delivery modes, we discuss the completed and current human clinical trials, as well as the use of vaccines in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors.", "metaData": {"source": "Environmental, genetic, and molecular features of prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15120667/"}}
