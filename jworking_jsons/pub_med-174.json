{"pageContent": "Background: Focal therapy (FT) is an option to treat localized prostate cancer (PCa) and preserve healthy prostate tissue in order to reduce known side effects from primary whole-gland treatment. The available FT modalities are manifold. Until now, national and international PCa guidelines have been cautious to propose recommendations regarding FT treatment since data from prospective controlled trials are lacking for most FT modalities. Moreover, none of the international guidelines provides a separate section on FT. In this purpose, we provide a synopsis of the consensus-based German S3 guidelines for a possible international use.", "metaData": {"source": "Correlation of pretreatment clinical parameters and PSA nadir after high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for localised prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24696277/"}}
