{"pageContent": "By drawing on a narrative analysis of 11 autobiographical illness memoirs, this article investigates the complexities of what it means to live with prostate cancer over a period of time. Acknowledging how cancer disrupts everyday life, we focus on the day-to-day experiences and struggles that take place inside and outside the hospital. By building on illustrative quotes from the memoirs, we discuss different facets of cancer as a lived experience. Our findings show that men reconstruct their identity in the memoirs in response to the disruptive nature of cancer by including various identities from previous times. They describe a relationship with their cancer that is fluid and fitful and often depends on place, time and circumstances. We also found that the 'not knowing' of prostate cancer creates uncertainty, which can take different forms, transcends time and is shaped through medical technologies, continual testing and disagreeing doctors. Prostate cancer is often seen as easily treatable, but our findings call for a different way of looking at its impact. We argue that memoirs, written by men themselves, make it palpable what it means to live with cancer. As such, illness memoirs offer a way to advance our sociological understanding of cancer-as-a-lived experience.", "metaData": {"source": "Do Men Receive Information Required for Shared Decision Making About PSA Testing?
