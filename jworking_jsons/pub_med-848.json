{"pageContent": "Purpose: The most prevalent intervention for localized prostate cancer (pca) is radical prostatectomy (rp), which has a 10-year relative survival rate of more than 90%. The improved survival rate has led to a focus on reducing the burden of treatment-related morbidity and improving the patient and partner survivorship experience. Post-rp sexual dysfunction (sdf) has received significant attention, given its substantial effect on patient and partner health-related quality of life. Accordingly, there is a need for sdf treatment to be a fundamental component of pca survivorship programming.", "metaData": {"source": "Magnetic resonance imaging-guided ultrasound ablation for prostate cancer - A contemporary review of performance\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36686753/"}}
