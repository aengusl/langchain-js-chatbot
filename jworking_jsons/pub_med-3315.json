{"pageContent": "This report summarizes the presentations and discussions that took place at the Sixth Joint Meeting of J-CaP and CaPSURE held in San Francisco, USA, in August 2012. The J-CaP and CaPSURE Joint Initiative was established in 2007 with the objective of analyzing, reviewing, comparing and contrasting data for prostate cancer patients from Japan and the USA within the two important large-scale, longitudinal, observational databases-J-CaP and CaPSURE. Since this initial collaboration between teams in the USA and Japan, the initiative has now expanded to include representatives of other Asian countries, several of whom have either established or are planning their own national prostate cancer databases. Several key topics were considered at this Sixth Joint Meeting including the current status of the J-CaP and CaPSURE databases and opportunities for collaboration with the more recently developed Asian prostate cancer databases. The latest comparative data from J-CaP and CaPSURE regarding outcomes following androgen deprivation therapy and combined androgen blockade were also reviewed. The possibility of a global chemoprevention trial to investigate the influence of soy isoflavones on prostate cancer incidence was considered. In addition, the ongoing debate regarding the role of screening and the use of active surveillance as a treatment option in the USA was discussed. The collaborators agreed that sharing of data and treatment practices on a global scale would undoubtedly benefit the clinical management of prostate cancer patients worldwide.", "metaData": {"source": "Clinical trials of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy for prostate cancer: updates and future direction\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25757684/"}}
