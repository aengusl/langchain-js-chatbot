{"pageContent": "The primary indication for prostate MR and MR spectroscopic imaging is evaluating men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer who are deciding whether to undergo surgery or radiotherapy. Other applications of MR and MR spectroscopic imaging in prostate cancer are not defined fully. Areas of research include volumetric localization of prostate cancer, in vivo MR spectroscopic imaging at high field strength, in vitro MR spectroscopic imaging at very high field strength, novel spectroscopic markers of malignancy,and interventional MR guidance of biopsy and therapy. MR spectroscopic imaging remains a relatively novel technique, and successful implementation is demanding. Nonetheless, only MR and MR spectroscopic imaging allow structural and metabolic evaluation of prostate cancer location, aggressiveness, and stage, and MR imaging provides clinically and therapeutically relevant information on prostatic and periprostatic anatomy.", "metaData": {"source": "Clinical significance of unfavorable findings in intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients for predicting treatment outcomes after contemporary, dose-escalated multimodal radiotherapy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34914134/"}}
