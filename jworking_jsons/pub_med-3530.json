{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignancies threatening men's health, and the mechanisms underlying its initiation and progression are poorly understood. Last decade has witnessed encouraging progress in the studies of prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs), which are considered to play important roles in tumor initiation, recurrence and metastasis, castration resistance, and drug resistance. Therefore, a deeper insight into PCSCs is of great significance for the successful management of prostate cancer. This article presents an overview on the location, origin, and markers of PCSCs as well as their potential correlation with tumor metastasis and castration resistance.", "metaData": {"source": "Management of patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) in a rural part of North Norway with a scattered population: does living near the department of oncology translate into a different pattern of care and survival?\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31120400/"}}
