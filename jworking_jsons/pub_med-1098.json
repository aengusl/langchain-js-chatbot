{"pageContent": "Health-related quality of life must be a factor when treatment options are discussed with a patient. Quality of life is measured by validated questionnaires that include generic and disease-targeted measures. Urinary and rectal symptoms and sexual function are evaluated after treatment for prostate cancer. Quality of life is adversely affected in the early post-brachytherapy period primarily by the urinary morbidity. Urinary symptoms peak 2 months after treatment and decline thereafter, although severe long-term urinary toxicity occurs in 3% to 12% of patients. Urinary symptoms are generally treated with alpha-blocker and anticholinergic drugs, but 2% to 5% of patients require transurethral resection of the prostate to relieve persistent obstruction. However, 6 months after treatment, overall satisfaction is excellent, and the majority of patients would recommend the procedure to a friend.", "metaData": {"source": "Prospective assessment of urinary, gastrointestinal and sexual symptoms before, during and after image-guided volumetric modulated arc therapy for prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24793783/"}}
