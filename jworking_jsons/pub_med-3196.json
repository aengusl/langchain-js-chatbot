{"pageContent": "Prostate cancer (PCa) has long been a major public health problem affecting men worldwide. Even with treatment, it can develop into castration\u2011resistant PCa. With the continuous advancement in epigenetics, researchers have explored N6\u2011methyladenosine (m6A) in search of a more effective and lasting treatment for PCa. m6A is widely distributed in mammalian cells and influences various aspects of mRNA metabolism. Recently, it has been associated with the development or suppression of various types of cancer, including PCa. This review summarizes the recent findings on m6A regulation and its functions and mechanisms in cells, focusing on the various functional proteins operating within m6A in PCa cells. Moreover, the potential clinical value of exploiting m6A modification as an early diagnostic marker in PCa diagnosis and therapeutics was discussed. m6A may also be used as an indicator to evaluate treatment outcome and prognosis.", "metaData": {"source": "The case for androgen deprivation as primary therapy for early stage disease: results from J-CaP and CaPSURE\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17084166/"}}
