{"pageContent": "Objectives: Though the external beam radiation therapy is a standard treatment option for both organ-confined and regionally advanced prostate cancer, unluckily, despite more and more effective advances in radiation delivery procedures, the prostate cancer radioresistance still occurs in a significant amount of patients undergone radiotherapy. This review aims to highlight the molecular aberrations of prostate cancer cell growth- and apoptosis signaling pathways that might induce, together with both prostate cancer cell/cancer stem cells gene- and surrounding microenvironment crucial implications, the tumor radioresistance.", "metaData": {"source": "Knowledge and attitudes regarding clinical trials and willingness to participate among prostate cancer patients\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26435199/"}}
