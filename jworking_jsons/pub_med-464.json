{"pageContent": "Diagnosis of the prostate cancer is based on clinical, biochemical and histological examinations, as well as various imaging techniques. From the last listed group, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides precise identification of focal areas and local staging of the cancer. It improves evaluation of the local extracapsular extension and involvement of regional lymph nodes, which has significant implications for a patient management. MRI, supplemented by dynamic contrast enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), is especially useful in detection of small focal lesions. MRI also plays an important role in the evaluation of a local recurrence and monitoring of the early and late response to treatment. Whole-body MRI should be performed in patients with a disseminated disease. In patients with an increased level of prostate specific antigen (PSA), small lesions, local recurrence and distant metastases, not detected by other imaging techniques, a positron emission tomography (PET) should be also performed. Computed tomography (CT) does not play a significant role in the diagnosis of the primary prostate cancer, however new CT scanners improve the accuracy of prostate cancer staging. Diagnostic imaging is also widely used in the screening process. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) examination of the organ is applied to obtain systematic core biopsies for a histological examination.", "metaData": {"source": "The PICTURE study: diagnostic accuracy of multiparametric MRI in men requiring a repeat prostate biopsy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28350785/"}}
