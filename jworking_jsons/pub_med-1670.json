{"pageContent": "The lack of clear roles for prostate cancer survivorship care providers places prostate cancer survivors at significant risk of inappropriate use of services delivered piecemeal by different providers, persistent bothersome symptoms, and silent suffering. Optimizing quality of care for prostate cancer survivors hinges on decreasing fragmentation of care, and providing quality symptom management. This is achieved through comprehensive, appropriate medical, surgical, pharmacological and psychosocial care, coupled with self-management, as highlighted in several recent resources addressing long-term and late effects of treatment. Although further study is warranted, prostate cancer survivors engaging in self-management may reduce the negative impact of prostate cancer in their lives through better quality of care (better symptom management and efficient use of services) and quality of life.", "metaData": {"source": "Long-term health-related quality-of-life outcomes after permanent prostate brachytherapy\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19145092/"}}
