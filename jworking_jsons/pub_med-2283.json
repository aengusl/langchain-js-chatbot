{"pageContent": "Purpose: Obesity (body mass index 30 kg/m2 or greater) is associated with better overall survival in metastatic prostate cancer. Conversely, low muscle mass (sarcopenia) and low muscle radiodensity (myosteatosis) are associated with worse overall survival in many cancers. This study seeks to evaluate the relationship of sarcopenia, myosteatosis and obesity with overall survival in men with metastatic or castrate-resistant prostate cancer.", "metaData": {"source": "Hormone stimulation and chemotherapy in advanced prostate cancer: interim analysis of an ongoing randomized trial\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3518596/"}}
