{"pageContent": "Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided systematic biopsy, the current gold standard for the detection of prostate cancer, suffers from low sensitivity for clinically significant cancer. The use of diagnostic multiparametric MRI has increased the relevance of targeted biopsy techniques such as MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy and direct (in-bore) MRI-guided biopsy, which have higher detection rate for clinically significant cancer. Although primarily used in patients who remain at high clinical suspicion for prostate cancer despite a negative systematic biopsy, with the increasing use of upfront diagnostic MRI, these biopsies are expected to replace routine systematic biopsies. This pictorial essay aims to enhance our understanding of the concepts of these biopsy techniques so that they can be performed safely and provide maximum diagnostic yield.", "metaData": {"source": "Beam distortion due to gold fiducial markers during salvage high-intensity focused ultrasound in the prostate\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28032342/"}}
