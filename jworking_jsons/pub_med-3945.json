{"pageContent": "Because the present ability to treat and cure patients with prostate cancer is limited to those patients with pathologically organ-confined disease, it has become increasingly important to diagnose this disease at an early stage, when cure is most likely. Recent advances in imaging may allow the urologist and the pathologist to make the diagnosis of prostate cancer much earlier in the natural course of the disease. It therefore becomes imperative to have methods available to predict which patients have a high probability of progressing so that treatment can be assigned logically and appropriately. Our current methods of prognosis determination (stage and grade) do not allow accurate assessment of tumor behavior in the majority of individual patients with prostate cancer. Therefore, more accurate quantification of nuclear and cellular changes that take place as a tumor progresses to take on the aggressive (metastatic) phenotype are urgently needed. Experimental techniques have proven useful in answering these questions and now seem ready for large-scale testing in clinical studies.", "metaData": {"source": "Prostate cancer.
