{"pageContent": "Background/aim: Patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer after primary radiotherapy can be eligible for salvage treatment. Whole-gland salvage techniques carry a high risk of toxicity. A focal salvage approach might reduce the risk of adverse events while maintaining cancer control in carefully selected patients. The aim of this review was to evaluate current literature to assess whether focal salvage leads to a comparable or favourable recurrence rate and less toxicity compared to whole-gland salvage.", "metaData": {"source": "Transrectal high-intensity focused ultrasound in the treatment of localized prostate cancer\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16053358/"}}
